{"dataset": "gsm8k", "approach": "compress", "prompt": "You are creating ultra-compressed reasoning chains for math problems. Follow these rules:\n\n1. Replace reasoning words with symbols:\n   - \"calculate/compute/find\" → §\n   - \"multiply/times\" → ×\n   - \"divide/divided by\" → ÷\n   - \"add/plus/sum\" → +\n   - \"subtract/minus\" → -\n   - \"equals/is/gives\" → =\n   - \"therefore/so/thus\" → ∴\n   - \"total/final\" → T\n   - \"step/then/next\" → →\n\n2. Replace verbs with action symbols:\n   - State/possession verbs (has, have, is, earns, costs) → ◇\n   - Action/transfer verbs (sold, gave, read, writes, bought, worked, did) → ⇒\n   - Requirement verbs (needs, should, must, wants) → ◆\n\n3. AGGRESSIVELY compress ALL time/context references:\n   - ANY time word (today, yesterday, tomorrow, April, May, week, year, minute, hour, day) → ◎\n   - \"per X\" / \"for X\" / \"since X\" / \"every X\" → / or drop entirely\n   - Drop phrases like \"left\", \"remaining\", \"altogether\", \"in total\"\n   - Keep $ for money, drop other unit words (clips, pages, books) unless critical\n\n4. Remove ALL: articles, prepositions, pronouns, names, and descriptive phrases\n\n5. Keep ONLY: numbers, operation symbols, action symbols, and essential results\n\n6. Use ∅ as optional placeholder where context was removed (RL will optimize this later)\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nReasoning: Natalia sold 48/2 = 24 clips in May. Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether in April and May.\nAnswer: 72\n\nOutput:\n⇒ 48÷2 = 24 ◎ → ⇒ 48+24 = 72 T\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nReasoning: Weng earns 12/60 = $0.2 per minute. Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $10.\nAnswer: 10\n\nOutput:\n◇ 12÷60 = 0.2/◎ → ⇒ 0.2×50 = 10\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\nReasoning: In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = $50. Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = $30. This means, Betty needs 100 - 50 - 30 - 15 = $5 more.\nAnswer: 5\n\nOutput:\n◇ 100÷2 = 50. → ⇒ 15×2 = 30. → ◆ 100-50-30-15 = 5 T\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nReasoning: Maila read 12 x 2 = 24 pages today. So she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = 36 pages since yesterday. There are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read. Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = 42 pages.\nAnswer: 42\n\nOutput:\n⇒ 12×2 = 24 ◎ → ⇒ 12+24 = 36 T. → 120-36 = 84. → ◆ 84÷2 = 42 ◎\n\nNow compress this reasoning.

{"dataset": "all", "approach": "poly1", "prompt": "You are creating compressed reasoning chains using symbolic notation. This works for ANY type of reasoning: mathematical, logical, causal, procedural, comparative, etc.\n\nAVAILABLE SYMBOLS (use however you find most efficient):\n\nFlow & Logic:\n- → ⇒ ∴ ⟹ (directional flow, causation, consequence)\n- ∧ ∨ ¬ (and, or, not)\n- ◆ (conditional: if/when/given)\n- § (marker/separator)\n\nComparison & Relations:\n- = ≠ > < ≥ ≤ ≈\n- ∈ ⊂ ∪ ∩ (membership, subset, union, intersection)\n\nMath Operations:\n- + - × ÷ (when needed)\n\nState Markers:\n- ◇ (state/property/attribute)\n- ◎ (temporal/context marker)\n- ∅ (null/absence/empty)\n- T (terminal/final/result)\n\nKeep: Numbers, key entities (as abbreviations), critical technical terms\n\nCOMPRESSION PRINCIPLES:\n1. Radical brevity - Every word should justify its existence\n2. Symbolic flow - Replace narrative with symbolic relationships\n3. Strip context fluff - Remove: articles, pronouns, descriptive phrases, redundant words\n4. Preserve logic - Keep the causal/logical chain intact\n5. Develop your encoding - Use symbols consistently; create your own shorthand\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nInput:\nQuestion: If John has 24 apples and gives away half to Mary, then buys 10 more, how many does he have?\nReasoning: John starts with 24 apples. He gives away 24/2 = 12 apples to Mary, leaving him with 12. Then he buys 10 more, so he has 12 + 10 = 22 apples.\nAnswer: 22\n\nOutput:\n24 → 24÷2=12 ⇒ 24-12=12 → 12+10=22 T\n\nInput:\nQuestion: All birds can fly. Penguins are birds. Can penguins fly?\nReasoning: The premise states all birds can fly. Penguins are identified as birds. Therefore, by the given logic, penguins can fly. However, this contradicts real-world knowledge.\nAnswer: Yes (by given premises), but actually no.\n\nOutput:\nbirds ⇒ fly ∧ penguin ∈ birds ∴ penguin ⇒ fly [◇contradiction]\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Why did the plant die?\nReasoning: The owner forgot to water the plant for 2 weeks. Without water, the soil became dry. Dry soil meant the roots couldn't absorb nutrients. Without nutrients, the plant cells died. Dead cells caused the whole plant to die.\nAnswer: Lack of water led to nutrient deprivation.\n\nOutput:\n¬water 2wk ⟹ soil◇dry ⟹ roots¬absorb ⟹ cells¬nutrient ⟹ cells◇dead ⟹ plant◇dead T\n\nInput:\nQuestion: How many steps to make a sandwich?\nReasoning: First, get two slices of bread. Then, spread peanut butter on one slice. Next, spread jelly on the other slice. Finally, press the two slices together. That's 4 steps.\nAnswer: 4\n\nOutput:\n§1 bread×2 → §2 PB→slice1 → §3 jelly→slice2 → §4 slice1+slice2 ∴ 4 T\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Which company is larger, A or B?\nReasoning: Company A has 1000 employees and $50M revenue. Company B has 500 employees and $75M revenue. By employee count, A is larger. By revenue, B is larger. Revenue is typically the better metric for company size.\nAnswer: Company B\n\nOutput:\nA: emp=1000, rev=50M | B: emp=500, rev=75M → emp: A>B → rev: B>A → rev◇primary ∴ B>A T\n\nInput:\nQuestion: Should I buy product X or Y?\nReasoning: Product X costs $100 and has 4.5 stars from 1000 reviews. Product Y costs $80 and has 4.8 stars from 200 reviews. X has more reviews so higher confidence. Y is cheaper and higher rated but less validated. If budget matters, choose Y. If reliability matters, choose X.\nAnswer: Depends on priority\n\nOutput:\nX: $100,◇4.5⭐,n=1000 | Y: $80,◇4.8⭐,n=200 → X◇high_n ∧ Y◇high_rating → ◆budget ⇒ Y | ◆reliability ⇒ X\n\nNow compress this reasoning.
