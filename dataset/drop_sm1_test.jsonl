{"question": "Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat. However, it has been argued that the campaign had \"a profound effect upon Tibet, changing it forever, and for the worse at that, doing much to contribute to Tibet's loss of innocence.\".

A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed.

{"question": "The Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks in their second game against the Green Bay Packers in an NFC North showdown, with a division title on the line for the Packers. After a scoreless first quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 15-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. However, the Packers scored three unanswered touchdowns on Aaron Rodgers' touchdown passes to James Jones. The defending league MVP completed 23 of 36 passes for 291 yards, along with the touchdown passes. Cutler completed 12 of 21 passes for 135 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a 72.5 passer rating, and was sacked four times. After the Packers scored their first touchdown on Rodgers' touchdown pass to Jones late in the first half, Cutler's pass intended for Devin Hester was intercepted by Casey Hayward, which then became an eight-yard touchdown pass. The Packers then opened the second half when Rodgers threw another touchdown pass to Jones. Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery was later flagged for pass interference, nullifying a touchdown pass, and the Bears had to resort to Olindo Mare-substituting for Robbie Gould-kicking a 34-yard field goal. On the Bears following drive, they went three-and-out, and on the punt return, Randall Cobb threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who fumbled the ball. Anthony Walters then recovered the ball, but the Bears failed to capitalize on the turnover, failing to gain a yard, and the team had to resort to Mare's second 34-yard field goal. However, the Packers would hang on to defeat Chicago 21-13, clinching the NFC North. With the Bears' sixth straight loss to the Packers in the rivalry, the Bears dropped to 8-6.

Philippe de Chabot, a French general, led his army into Piedmont in March 1536, and proceeded to capture Turin the following month, but he failed to seize Milan. In response, Charles invaded Provence, a region of France, advancing to Aix-en-Provence, and took Aix in August 1536 but his movement was halted by the French Army blocking routes to Marseilles. Afterwards, Charles withdrew to Spain rather than attacking the heavily fortified Avignon. There is also a story that French troops deliberately left over-ripe fruit on the trees in an attempt to give Charles's troops dysentery. While Charles V was busy fighting for territory in France, he lost focus on events taking place in Italy. Francis I's armies received massive reinforcements in Piedmont in terms of generals, troops, and horses on a march headed for Genoa. France had secured an alliance with the Ottoman Empire in 1536 through the diplomatic efforts of Jean de La For\u00eat, France's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. A Franco-Turkish fleet was stationed in Marseille by the end of 1536, threatening Genoa, by planning to attack simultaneously with the French troops marching on land towards the city. Unfortunately for the French and Ottomans, when they arrived in Genoa in August 1536 the defenses of the city had been recently reinforced. Instead, the troops marched onto Piedmont, capturing many towns there. In 1537 Barbarossa raided the Italian coast and laid a siege at Corfu, although this provided only limited assistance to the French.

{"question": "The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \"Popish Plot\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne.

{"question": "Following Jenkins' testimony and petitions from other West Indies merchants, the opposition in Parliament voted on 28 March 1738 to send \"an Address\" to the King, asking his Majesty to seek redress from Spain. More than one year later, all diplomatic means having been exhausted, on 10 July 1739 King George II authorised the Admiralty Board to seek maritime reprisals against Spain.

After arriving at the island of Antigua in early October 1739, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sent three ships under the command of Captain Thomas Waterhouse to intercept Spanish merchant ships that made the route between La Guaira and Porto Bello. Waterhouse spotted several small vessels in the port of La Guaira and decided to attack, implementing a rudimentary plan. The governor of the Province of Venezuela, Brigadier Don Gabriel de Zuloaga had prepared the port defences, and Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo. On 22 October, Waterhouse entered the port of La Guaira flying the Spanish flag. Expecting attack, the port gunners were not deceived by his ruse; they waited until the British squadron was within range and then simultaneously opened fire. After three hours of heavy shelling, Waterhouse ordered a withdrawal. The battered British squadron sailed to Jamaica to undertake emergency repairs.

{"question": "The peace Treaty of Limerick signed on 3 October 1691 offered favourable terms to Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William III. Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, cuimhnig\u00ed Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh . The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland. Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose. This event was popularly known in Ireland as the \"Flight of the Wild Geese\". Around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691.

However, in 1617 Polish forces, besieged in Smolensk  by Russian forces, were relieved by Lisowczycy, when Russian forces retreated to Bely soon after receiving news that Lisowczycy, then commanded by Stanis\u0142aw Czapi\u0144ski, had appeared in the area. In 1618 Petro Sahaidachny's campaign against Muscovy resulted in sacking numerous forts such as Putivl, Kursk, Yelets, and others. Together with Chodkiewicz he laid siege to Moscow in September 1618.

{"question": "Precise measurements of atmospheric Absorption (electromagnetic radiation) were not made until 1888 and 1904. The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950 \u00b0C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200 K. As 2.574  43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430 \u00b0C or 5700 K (the modern value is 5778 K). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800 \u00b0C to as high as 13,000,000 \u00b0C were claimed. The lower value of 1800 \u00b0C was determined by Claude Pouillet (1790\u20131868) in 1838 using the Dulong\u2013Petit law. Pouillet also took just half the value of the Suns correct energy flux.

The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions.

{"question": "Also in August 1689, 1,500 Iroquois, seeking revenge for Governor General Denonville's actions, attacked the French settlement at Lachine. Count Frontenac, who replaced Denonville as governor general, later attacked the Iroquois village of Onondaga. New France and its Indian allies then attacked English frontier settlements in early 1690, most notably at Schenectady in New York. This was followed up by two expeditions. One, on land under Connecticut provincial militia general Fitz-John Winthrop, targeted Montreal; the other, led by Sir William Phips, targeted Quebec. Winthrop's expedition failed due to disease and supply issues, and Phips was defeated in the Battle of Quebec. The Quebec and Port Royal expeditions were the only major New England offensives of King William's War; for the remainder of the war the English colonists were primarily engaged in defensive operations, skirmishes and retaliatory raids. The Iroquois Five Nations suffered from the weakness of their English allies.:290 In 1693 and 1696, the French and their Indian allies ravaged Iroquois towns and destroyed crops while New York colonists remained passive. After the English and French made peace in 1697, the Iroquois, now abandoned by the English colonists, remained at war with New France until 1701,:291 when a peace was agreed at Montreal between New France and a large number of Iroquois and other tribes.

While there were retaliatory raids and skirmishes, the text specifies only two major expeditions \u2014 the one to Montreal and the one to Quebec \u2014 and refers to them collectively as the \"Quebec and Port Royal expeditions.\"\n\nNote: The mention of \"Port Royal\" may suggest a third expedition, but Port Royal was in Acadie (modern-day Nova Scotia), and the text refers to the \"Quebec and Port Royal expeditions\" as two in number.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth.

{"question": "The conflict is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. There had already been a King George's War in the 1740s during the reign of King George II, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire. In Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, which was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760. Canadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years' War .

{"question": "In 1712, Tordenskjold succeeded in burning 80 Swedish naval cruisers, which played a large part in the outcome of the Great Nordic War . Since Scandinavia now was at peace, the navy focused its resources on other parts of the world, partaking in the colonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. A permanent naval presence of shifting strength was maintained in the Mediterranean Sea - protecting Danish-Norwegian interests in the region - mainly commerces against piracy. The Danish Mediterranean Squadron had numerous minor engagements with The Barbary States during the 1700s and 1800s. On several occasions these hostilities escalated to substantial actions. Some of the more notable can be said to be: the Mediterranean Squadron's bombardment of Algiers in 1770 under the command of contreadmiral Frederik Christian Kaas; the then captain, and future Privy Councillor, Steen Andersen Bille's action at Tripoli in 1797; and commander Hans Georg Garde in a joint Scandinavian expedition in 1844 - which effectively ended the Barbary states' attacks on Scandinavian merchants in the region.

{"question": "Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia.

{"question": "Uro\u0161 III's decision not to attack the Byzantines after the victory at the Battle of Velbazhd against Bulgaria resulted in the alienation of many nobles, who sought to expand to the south. By January or February 1331, Du\u0161an was quarreling with his father, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Du\u0161an sources, evil advisors turned Uro\u0161 III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Du\u0161an of his inheritance. Uro\u0161 III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Du\u0161an had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uro\u0161 III ordered Du\u0161an to meet him. Du\u0161an feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Du\u0161an marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where he besieged his father. Uro\u0161 III fled, and Du\u0161an captured the treasury and family. He then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petri\u0107. On 21 August 1331, Uro\u0161 III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Du\u0161an's advisors, he was imprisoned. Du\u0161an was crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. The civil war had prevented Serbia from aiding Ivan Stephen and Anna Neda in Bulgaria, who were deposed in March 1331, taking refuge in the mountains. Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria feared for the danger of Serbia as the situation there had settled, and immediately sought peace with Du\u0161an. As Du\u0161an wanted to move against richer Byzantium, the two made peace and an alliance in December 1331, accepting Ivan Alexander as ruler.

{"question": "Coming off a divisional win at home over the Bills, the Patriots traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for a matchup with the Bengals. On the game's opening drive, the Patriots drove 66&#160;yards on 11 plays, stalling at the Bengals' 13-yard line before Gostkowski hit a 31-yard field goal. The Bengals' next drive would span five plays but only one yard, ending in a punt. After an exchange of punts, the Patriots began a drive from their own 35-yard line, but quickly advanced into Bengals territory on a 49-yard Morris run. Three plays later, Brady hit Vrabel on a 1-yard touchdown pass to extend the Patriots lead to 10-0. After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by Leon Hall at the Bengals' 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with Carson Palmer ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17-7. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots' 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half. The Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24-7. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots' 22-yard line before linebacker Tedy Bruschi tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard Shayne Graham field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals' 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27-13. On the Patriots' next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34-13, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by Randall Gay at the Patriots' 47-yard line.

In the third quarter, New Orleans retook the lead with RB Pierre Thomas getting a 24-yard TD run. On the Falcons' next possession, Leftwich's left leg got injured during a sack by Saints DE Will Smith. Harrington took over for the rest of the game.

{"question": "The Broncos, making their first visit to New Orleans since 2004, jumped out to a 10-0 lead. First, quarterback Trevor Siemian connected with wide receiver Jordan Taylor on a 14-yard touchdown pass. The touchdown was initially ruled as an incomplete pass, but overturned by a replay challenge. Following an interception of Saints' quarterback Drew Brees by cornerback Darian Stewart, placekicker Brandon McManus added a 50-yard field goal early in the second quarter. The Broncos were attempting to add to their lead just before halftime, however Siemian was intercepted by cornerback Sterling Moore, and the Saints quickly advanced 50 yards in only 29 seconds, culminating in a 30-yard field goal by placekicker Will Lutz. Early in the third quarter, the Saints tied the game, with Brees connecting with wide receiver Willie Snead on a 3-yard touchdown pass. On the Broncos' second possession of the second half, Siemian was intercepted by safety Kenny Vaccaro, and four plays later, another touchdown pass from Brees to Snead from 5 yards out gave the Saints a 17-10 lead. On the Broncos next drive, McManus missed wide left on a 42-yard field attempt early in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Saints' next possession, Broncos' cornerback Bradley Roby forced a fumble off wide receiver Michael Thomas, which was recovered by Stewart at the Saints' 27-yard line. Seven plays later, the Broncos tied the game, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Siemian to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. After forcing the Saints to go three-and-out, the Broncos drove down the field, but had to settle on a 28-yard field goal by McManus. The Broncos' defense forced another fumble deep in Saints' territory, but had to settle on a 37-yard field goal by McManus with 2:50 remaining in the game, while forcing the Saints to burn the last two of their three team timeouts. The Saints then drove 75 yards in only six plays, culminating in Brees throwing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandin Cooks to tie the game at 23-23 with 1:30 remaining in the game. However, Lutz's extra point attempt was blocked by Justin Simmons, and Will Parks scooped up the football and ran to the end zone for a defensive two-point conversion. The Saints claimed that Parks may have stepped out of bounds, but the initial ruling on the field was upheld after an instant replay review. The Saints' onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Broncos.

{"question": "Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats.

{"question": "Trying to halt a six-game losing streak, the Lions returned home to Ford Field for an interconference matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs. Detroit got on the board early with a T.J. Duckett 11-yard TD run and a safety off a blocked Dustin Colquitt punt. In the second quarter, the Lions opened up a 19-0 lead with a Jason Hanson field goal and a Paris Lenon interception return for a touchdown. Kansas City fought back with a Jackie Battle 3-yard run and a 1-yard pass from Damon Huard to Jared Allen to make it 19-14, but the Lions' Jason Hanson added two more field goals in the second half and the Chiefs could not convert a two-point conversion to Tony Gonzalez in the 3rd after a Dwayne Bowe receiving TD.

The safety itself is not measured in yards of advancement\u2014it's a score resulting from a blocked punt, and the yardage of the play (the block) isn't specified. But the safety is a scoring play, and it's not a run or pass. Still, the question asks for the *shortest scoring play* in terms of yards. Since a safety is a score, and it's not a run or pass, we must consider whether it counts.\n\n   However, the play that led to the safety was a blocked punt. The actual play (blocking the punt) may have been short, but the scoring play (the safety) is not measured in yards of advancement\u2014it's a score resulting from a blocked punt. So, in terms of yardage of the play, we typically don't assign yardage to a safety. Therefore, we may not count it as a \"scoring play\" in terms of yardage.\n\n3. **Paris Lenon interception return for a touchdown**  \n   \u2192 Interception return for a TD. The yardage isn't given, but we know it's a touchdown. The play is a return, and the yardage isn't specified.

Let's read carefully.\n\n   The text says: \"a 1-yard pass from Damon Huard to Jared Allen to make it 19-14\" \u2014 this is a touchdown.

We don't know how many yards.\n\n7. **Jason Hanson field goals** \u2014 field goals are not scoring plays in terms of yardage (they are 3 points, but not yardage-based).

{"question": "Prince Eugene was made commander in chief of the Army in the newly conquered Pannonian Plain on 5 July 1697. His army consisted  of 70,000 men at full strength of whom only 35,000 were ready for battle. As the war chest was empty, Eugene had to borrow money in order to pay wages and to create a working medical service. The Habsburg Army consisted of German, Austrian, and Hungarian infantry and cavalry forces . Thanks to Palatine Paul Eszterh\u00e1zy, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary contributed to Ottoman-Habsburg wars with 20,000 soldiers. Serb light cavalry and Serbian Militia conscripts also took part in the coalition. When news arrived that the Sultan and his army were in Belgrade, Eugene decided to concentrate all his available troops from Upper Hungary and Transylvania and started to move his troops towards Petrovaradin. After the concentration took place, Eugene had an Imperial army of 50,000 to 55,000 men to face the Ottomans. On 18 July, in the village of Kolut, Eugene held a military review of his forces. Soon he left with forces to Petrovaradin via Sombor. During August, Eugene offered battle in the neighborhood of the fortress of Petrovaradin but the Ottomans, attempting to start a siege, refused to engage in battle. In September the Ottomans moved north in an attempt to capture the fortress of Szeged and the Imperial army followed. There were few Kuruc cavalries in the Ottoman army under Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly, however most of them fought alongside the Austrians. Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly was in charge of the Ottoman cavalry in battle.

The Serbian forces are mentioned as part of the **coalition**, not explicitly as part of the Habsburg Army.\n\nMoreover, the text says: \"Serb light cavalry and Serbian Militia conscripts also took part in the coalition.\" The term \"coalition\" suggests a broader alliance, not necessarily that the Serbs were part of the Habsburg Army. Since the Habs (Habsburg) Army is described as consisting of German, Austrian, and Hungarian forces, and the Serbs are mentioned as part of the coalition, they are likely not counted as part of the Habsburg Army per se, but rather as allied or auxiliary forces.\n\nTherefore, the **Habsburg Army** (as described) consists of:\n- German infantry and cavalry  \n- Austrian infantry and cavalry  \n- Hungarian infantry and cavalry  \n\nEven though each group has both infantry and cavalry, the question is asking for **how many different forces** \u2014 and since the forces are categorized by nationality (German, Austrian, Hungarian), and each has both infantry and cavalry, we count the **distinct national components**.\n\nSo, the different forces (in terms of national or regional military units) are:\n1.

The Patriots next four plays gained a net of zero yards, and Gostkowksi kicked a 21-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3-0 lead. After an exchange of punts, the Ravens took the lead with Kyle Boller completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason after a 70-yard drive. In the second quarter, Baltimore increased its lead when kicker Matt Stover converted a 29-yard field goal to cap a 12-play, 55-yard drive. On the ensuing drive, the Patriots responded with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that included two more Stallworth receptions and two more Ravens penalties and ended in a 1-yard Evans touchdown run. Two possessions later, with 56&#160;seconds remaining the first half, Brady threw his fifth interception of the season, this one to safety Ed Reed, who proceeded to fumble on the return. Watson recovered the fumble and the Patriots went into halftime in a 10-10 tie. On the opening drive of the second half, the Ravens drove 73&#160;yards and regained the lead on a 17-yard run by Willis McGahee, his sixth rush of the 8-play drive. The Patriots answered on their next possession with an 11-play, 72-yard drive that included a dump-off pass to Maroney for 36&#160;yards. A 3-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss tied the game again at 17-17. In the first minute of the fourth quarter, Baltimore got the lead again, 24-17, as Boller completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Wilcox after an 8-play, 56-yard drive. The Patriots went 3-and-out on their next drive, and a 33-yard Yamon Figurs punt return coupled with a 5-yard Pierre Woods penalty gave the Ravens the ball at the Patriots' 26-yard line with less than 13&#160;minutes remaining in the game. After two McGahee runs for 1&#160;yard and a false start penalty gave the Ravens a 3rd and 14 situation, Boller was intercepted at the Patriots' 1-yard line by Sanders to hold the Ravens scoreless on the drive. Sanders' 42-yard return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 43-yard line, and another Maroney dump-off pass for 43&#160;yards brought the Patriots to the Ravens' 24-yard line. The Patriots then failed to make the first down, and Gostkowski kicked another field goal, this one from 38&#160;yards out, to cut the Ravens' lead to 24-20. The Patriots defense, which gave up almost 60 first half rushing yards to McGahee, held McGahee to 1&#160;yard on the Ravens' next drive and forced a 3-and-out. The Patriots' ensuing drive brought them to the Ravens' 31-yard line before a 10-yard Dan Koppen penalty and incompletion forced another punt. With less than 6&#160;minutes remaining, the Patriots defense again prevented the Ravens offense from completing a first down and got the ball back with 3:30 left in the game. Starting from their own 27-yard line, the Patriots got to midfield on the second play of their drive with a 23-yard Watson reception. An incompletion and 9-yard Faulk catch brought 3rd and 1, where Brady rushed for 2&#160;yards and the first down. After the two-minute warning, another 9-yard Faulk catch on 3rd and 10 gave the Patriots a 4th and 1 from the Ravens' 30-yard line with 1:48 remaining. Brady attempted another sneak and was stopped short of the first, but the play was nullified by a timeout called by Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan just before the snap. Heath Evans lost a yard on the Patriots' next attempt, but a false start penalty by Russ Hochstein nullified the play and set up a 4th and 6. Brady scrambled for the first down and additionally, Ravens cornerback Samari Rolle was penalized for illegal contact to give the Patriots another 5&#160;yards, moving them to the Ravens' 18-yard line with 1:38 left on the clock. A 5-yard Faulk rush and two incompletions gave the Patriots another fourth down situation. Brady's throw to Watson in the end zone fell incomplete, but the Patriots again received a fresh set of downs after Ravens defensive back Jamaine Winborne was called for defensive holding. On 1st and goal from the Ravens' 8-yard line with 55&#160;seconds remaining, the Patriots took their first lead since the first quarter on a Gaffney touchdown reception that was upheld by official review. After the play, Ravens linebacker Bart Scott received two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after throwing an official's flag into the stands, and Reed was flagged for being offsides on the extra point, setting up a Patriots kickoff from the Ravens' 35-yard line. After a Gostkowski touchback on the kickoff, the Ravens completed two passes, bringing them to their own 45-yard line with 8&#160;seconds remaining. Boller threw a Hail Mary pass that was caught by wide receiver Mark Clayton at the Patriots' 3-yard line, but he was tackled shy of the end zone as time expired.

In the last MNF game at Texas Stadium, Dallas would duel with their NFC East foe, the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, the Cowboys trailed early as Eagles kicker David Akers got a 34-yard field goal.  Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB Tony Romo completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB Felix Jones returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook, along with LB Chris Gocong recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54. In the third quarter, the 'Boys regained the lead with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles once again took the lead with Westbrook's 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys rallied with Folk nailing a 47-yard field goal and Barber getting a 1-yard TD run.

{"question": "For the final home game of the 2017 season, the Bears hosted the winless Browns on Christmas Eve. In 15 regular season meetings, the Browns led the series 9-6, though the Bears had won the last two games. While the Browns were 0-14, head coach Hue Jackson was 2-0 in Christmas games, including recording the Browns' lone win of 2016 on the day. On offense, protecting Mitchell Trubisky from Gregg Williams' blitz-heavy defense; despite its frequency of utilizing the pass rush, the Browns ranked 29th in quarterback knockdowns with 62, while also allowing ten touchdowns on blitzes. Furthermore, the Browns defense led the league in fewest rushing yards allowed per carry on first down. For the Bears defense, it faced a Browns offense that turned the ball over 36 times, including 19 interceptions from quarterback DeShone Kizer. Entering the game, Chicago had just six interceptions in 2017, meaning Cleveland marked a prime opportunity to increase the stat. The Bears were 6.5-point favorites for the game; in three seasons under John Fox, the Bears had lost all seven games in which they were favored, including defeats to the Packers and 49ers in 2017. In spite of this, considering the Bears' opposition in week sixteen, 247Sports.com's Matt Eurich wrote it would be \"satisfying for many to at least see the Bears earn a victory for the first time in three years in which it has been favored.\" After the first three series ended with punts, Jordan Howard scored on a two-yard run, but Mike Nugent's extra point was blocked. Following five drives that featured three-and-outs, Kizer's pass for Josh Gordon was intercepted by Kyle Fuller, but the Bears were forced to punt. Zane Gonzalez kicked a 48-yard field goal with one second remaining in the first half to make the score 6-3 at halftime. On the first offensive play of the second half, Trubisky was intercepted by Myles Garrett, who returned the pick to the Bears' five-yard line, but the play was called back because of an offsides penalty on Carl Nassib. With the drive saved, Trubisky completed a 40-yard pass to Benny Cunningham to set the offense up in the Browns' red zone, which led to Howard's 16-yard touchdown run. Upon getting the ball back, Trubisky guided the offense downfield on a 66-yard drive that culminated in his four-yard touchdown run. A series later, Rashard Higgins caught Kizer's pass and reached the Bears' three-yard line, where he was stripped by Danny Trevathan and the ball went into the end zone, where Prince Amukamara recovered. Another takeaway for the Bears occurred with 4:11 left in the game, when Kizer's pass was intercepted by Bryce Callahan. However, neither team scored for the rest of the game as the Bears triumphed 20-3. With the win, the Bears defeated all four AFC North teams in 2017, a similar feat accomplished in 2013. Trubisky ran for 246 yards, the most by a Bears quarterback since Kordell Stewart in 2003, along with throwing for 193 yards; the latter increased his season passing yard total to 2,015, the most by a rookie in Bears history.

{"question": "In the winter of 1240/1241, the Novgorodians took Pereyaslavl-Zalessky. After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies, and took the Novgorod city of Tesov, pillaging its merchants and ravaging the surrounding area. The Novgorodians, fearing a fate similar to that of Pskov, sent envoys to Prince Yaroslav. Yaroslav liked Alexander's younger brother Andrew as a leader, but Novgorod insisted on Alexander. Alexander returned to Novgorod and commanded its army to Koporye in 1241. In the Spring of 1242, he recaptured Pskov. After this victory, Alexander decided to continue his campaign. On April 5, 1242, one of Russia's most famous battles, the Battle of the Ice, took place on the ice of Lake Peipsi. The battle was a significant defeat sustained by the crusaders during the Northern Crusades. The crusaders' defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the Orthodox Novgorod Republic and other Russian territories for the next century. How many years did the Novgorodians take Pereyaslavl-Zalessky?", "answer": "1", "original_reasoning": "The question asks: \"How many years did the Novgorodians take Pereyaslavl-Zalessky?\"\n\nLet's analyze the information provided:\n\n- The text states: \"In the winter of 1240/1241, the Novgorodians took Pereyaslavl-Zalessky.\"\n\nThis indicates that the capture occurred during the winter of 1240/1241. The phrase \"winter of 1240/1241\" refers to the period spanning late 1240 to early 1241.\n\nNow, the question is asking *how many years* did the Novgorodians take Pereyaslavl-Zalessky?\n\nImportant clarification: The event is a single event \u2014 the capture \u2014 which happened in the winter of 1240/1241. That is, it took place in one year (or a short period within that winter), not over a span of years.\n\nTherefore, the duration of time during which the Novgorodians *took* Pereyaslavl-Zalessky is not years of occupation, but rather a single event occurring in one winter (1240\u20131241). The question is asking how many years did they *take* it \u2014 which implies the length of time they held it.\n\nBut the text does not specify how long they held it. It only says they *took* it in the winter of 1240/1241. There is no mention of them holding it for years.\n\nMoreover, the next events (the Teutonic Knights building a fortress at Koporie, the capture of Tesov, and the campaign against Pskov and the Battle of the Ice in 1242) suggest that the Novgorodians were engaged in a campaign, but no indication that they held Pereyaslavl-Zalessky for years.\n\nIn fact, the text says: \"After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies...\" \u2014 indicating that the Teutonic Knights had taken control of the area after the Novgorodians had taken it. So, the Novgorodians likely did not hold it for years \u2014 they took it briefly, and then it was retaken or lost.\n\nThus, the phrase \"how many years did the Novgorodians take Pereyaslavl-Zalessky?\" is likely being interpreted as the duration of the capture \u2014 but the text gives no indication of a multi-year occupation.\n\nThe only relevant time mentioned is the winter of 1240/1241 \u2014 a period of about one year (spanning two calendar years, but still one event).\n\nTherefore, the Novgorodians took Pereyaslavl-Zalessky during a single winter \u2014 a period of about one year \u2014 and there is no indication they held it for more than that.\n\nHence, the answer is **one year**.", "reasoning": "S0[1240/1241] \u2192 S1[\u22971 year]\u2713 \u2192 S2[\u229b 1 year] \u27f9 S3[\u27131]"}

Shortly thereafter, Brian Griese connected to Alex Smith to tie the score at 7. Later in the second quarter, Green Bay faced 4th & 15 at their own 5-yard line.

{"question": "The Bears opened the season at home against the Buffalo Bills, who had a record of 6-10 in 2013. Entering the game, the Bears were 54-35-5 in season openers, the most wins of any team, and they had not lost an opening game since 2009, the most in the NFC and second-most in the NFL behind the New England Patriots. The Bears were 7-4 against the Bills, with their last meeting being a 22-19 victory in Toronto in 2010, while winning 40-7 in the last game between the two at Soldier Field; the Bears had won all five meetings between the two in Chicago. When comparing the two teams in 2013 statistically, the Bears had the advantage in three offensive categories (points scored, total offense, and passing offense), while the Bills had the second-best rushing offense, compared to the Bears' 16th-ranked rushing game. On defense, the Bears were outmatched in all three categories (total defense, rushing defense, and passing defense), but are one spot higher than Buffalo in turnover ratio (+5 to +3). Scout.com's Jeremy Stoltz writes that one of the players the Bears must contain is the defensive tackle duo of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus, who had a combined 139 total tackles, 18.0 sacks and two forced fumbles during 2013. While the Bears' offensive line boasted the fourth-least sacks, none of the five starters played in the preseason. As a result, to combat the rush, the Bears need Jay Cutler to release the ball quickly. For the Bears' defense, Stoltz stated all the Bears needed to do was stop Buffalo's running backs Fred Jackson and C. J. Spiller, as the Bills had the second-best rushing attack in the league. The Bears were favored to win by seven points, the third-largest spread of the week. Matt Fort&#233;, Charles Tillman, and Robbie Gould were the captains for the game. David Fales, Kelvin Hayden, Tony Fiammetta, Khaseem Greene, Charles Leno, Jr., David Bass and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and elected to kick. After Buffalo punted, Chicago scored on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, which the Bills retaliated with E. J. Manuel's two-yard touchdown run. On the Bears' first drive of the second quarter, Brandon Marshall fumbled, with linebacker Preston Brown recovering; the Bills would score on Dan Carpenter's 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler was intercepted by former Bear Corey Graham after Bennett did not \"turn to look for the ball in time\", with the Bills again capitalizing on the takeaway, with Manuel's seven-yard touchdown pass to Spiller, and the half ended with Buffalo leading 17-7. On the Bears' first possession of the third quarter, Gould kicked a five-yard field goal, and on the Bills' first drive of the half, Chris Conte read a pass intended for Marquise Goodwin, stepping in front of the pass to intercept the ball. On Chicago's ensuing drive, the offense rallied to tie the score on Cutler's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove from their own six-yard line to reach the Buffalo 34, but Cutler's forced pass intended for Bennett was intercepted by Kyle Williams; Carpenter would kick a 33-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Gould's 37-yarder. The Bills would kneel to end regulation with a 20-20 score. After the Bears went three-and-out, the Bills started on their own 22-yard line, but drove to the Bears' 39. On the next play, Jackson found a hole in the line of scrimmage, getting past Lance Briggs. Conte reached Jackson at the 20-yard line, but was stiff-armed; Conte attempted to tackle again, but was knocked down, with Jackson being pushed out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays later, Carpenter kicked the game-winning 27-yard field goal. Four of the Bears' offensive starters suffered injuries during the game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) did not play after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, \"It was a play where it's the end of the game - I've got to get the ball out or something.

{"question": "After World War II, amateur radio operators in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. \"The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society\" was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to \"The VHF Teletype Society\" and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSWs test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \"The RTTY Society of Southern California\" publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.

The total number of years during which the plague was present in Venice (i.e., the duration of the entire period from first to last outbreak).\n2. The total number of years across all outbreaks (i.e., sum of the durations of each outbreak).\n\nBut the phrasing \"how many years spanned\" most naturally refers to the time period during which the plague was present \u2014 that is, the total span of years from the first outbreak to the last, regardless of how many times it occurred.\n\nFrom the text: \"Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.\"\n\nSo, the first outbreak began in 1361 and the last one ended in 1528.

{"question": "Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Panthers, the Cardinals flew to FedExField for a Week 7 duel with the Washington Redskins.  QB Kurt Warner got the start, despite having a torn left elbow ligament. In the first quarter, Arizona trailed early as Redskins RB Clinton Portis got a 2-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, things got worse for the Cards as Warner's second interception was returned by LB London Fletcher 27 yards for a touchdown.  Arizona would finally respond as Warner threw a 2-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin (with a failed PAT).

The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal.

On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season.

Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return.

In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire.

{"question": "The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the Teutonic Order of German crusading knights which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century. Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially converted to  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights. The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia , an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades.

Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore.

This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will.

{"question": "The parishes of Repola and Poraj\u00e4rvi of the Olonets Governorate had voted in favor of secession from Bolshevist Russia and had been occupied by Finland later that year. In late 1919 the Russian White Army retreated towards the Finnish border to the Repola-Poraj\u00e4rvi area. The Finnish government led by Juho Vennola decided in February 1920 that Finland should intervene to help the dissidents by diplomatic means. Foreign minister Rudolf Holsti sent a message to his counterpart Georgy Chicherin stating that Finland would disarm the retreating Russian White troops if the Red Army does not occupy the parishes. Agreement was honoured by both parties, although there were minor skirmishes between Finnish troops and the Red Army. These fights led to armistice negotiations in Rajajoki, which ended unsuccessfully after two weeks. There had been uprisings in White Karelia as early as 1920. After British forces left Karelia, Karelian ethnic nationalists arranged a meeting in Ukhta  in March-April 1920 where they elected 117 representatives. In the meeting they decided that White Karelia should become an independent nation. Some parishes of Olonets Karelia joined in and the V\u00e4liaikainen toimikunta  renamed itself to Karjalan v\u00e4liaikainen hallitus . However, the Red Army suppressed this uprising and in summer 1920 the Temporary Government fled to Finland. In its place, the Karelian Worker's Commune was formed, an autonomous oblast of the RSFSR. During the treaty negotiations, Finland proposed a referendum in East Karelia, through which its residents could choose whether they wanted to join Finland or Soviet Russia. Due to opposition from Russia, Finland had to withdraw the initiative.

{"question": "With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region.

This alliance was used to block Iroquois expansion, and the English supported the Susquehannock by supplying them with artillery, which shifted the balance of power in their favor.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia  returned to Poland.

Apraksin's forces reached the river but chose not to cross it and instead withdrew back to Vyborg, likely due to problems in supply.

{"question": "After their loss to Atlanta, Washington hosted the Minnesota Vikings, looking to snap an 8-game home losing streak. The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line.

{"question": "By September 1545, the war was a virtual stalemate; both sides, running low on funds and troops, unsuccessfully sought help from the German Protestants. Henry, Francis, and Charles attempted extensive diplomatic maneuvering to break the deadlock; but none of the three trusted the others, and this had little practical effect. In January 1546, Henry sent the Earl of Hertford to Calais, apparently preparing for an offensive; but one failed to materialize. Francis could not afford to resume a large-scale war, and Henry was concerned only for the disposition of Boulogne. Negotiations between the two resumed on 6 May. On 7 June 1546, the Treaty of Ardres\u2014also known as the Treaty of Camp\u2014was signed by Claude d'Annebault, Pierre Ramon, and Guillaume Bochetel on behalf of Francis, and Viscount Lisle, Baron Paget and Nicholas Wotton on behalf of Henry. By its terms, Henry would retain Boulogne until 1554, then return it in exchange for two million \u00e9cus; in the meantime, neither side would construct fortifications in the region, and Francis would resume payment of Henry's pensions. Upon hearing the price demanded for Boulogne, the Imperial ambassador told Henry that the city would remain in English hands permanently. During the treaty negotiations, two Protestant mediators\u2014Han Bruno of Metz and Johannes Sturm\u2014were concerned that Henry's war in Scotland was a stumbling block. The sixteenth article of the treaty made Scotland a party to the new peace, and Henry pledged not to attack the Scots again without cause.

{"question": "After Alaungpaya's death, the new Burmese king Naungdawgyi was embroiled in several rebellions, including that of Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta, and could not resume the war. The war was inconclusive. For all their work, the Burmese gained little of their original objectives. Siam very much remained a thorn to the stability of Burmese peripheral regions. In the following years, Siam continued to provide support to Mon rebels in the south who raised a major rebellion in 1762 as well as those in Lan Na in the north . The only lasting territorial gain the Burmese achieved was the upper Tenasserim coast, on which they previously had only a nominal claim.  Although the Siamese troops no longer openly intruded the border, the Mon rebels continued to operate from the Siamese territory. In 1764, the Mon governor of Tavoy, who was made governor by Alaungpaya only four years earlier, revolted until it was put down in November 1764. Likewise, the instabilities in Lan Na resumed soon after the Burmese army left in February 1764, forcing the army to return again later in the year.

San Diego had gone ahead with 1:56 to play on a 1-yard touchdown run by Oliver. Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left. On the following possession, Rivers completed the first four passes for 70 yards, which led to a 30-yard field goal by Novak. The Chargers defense forced a three-and-out, when Allen&#8212;filling in for an injured Royal&#8212;returned the punt 29 yards to the Oakland 39. With 4:49 remaining, Rivers led the six-play game-winning TD drive which culminated with four straight runs by Oliver for 29 yards. The Raiders had the ball on the Chargers 45 on second-and-one, when Carr threw deep for Butler, but Verrett leaped for an acrobatic sideline interception. Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass. Oliver ran for 101 yards in the game, and Rivers threw for 313 yards and three touchdowns. For Rivers, it was an NFL-record fifth straight game with at least a 120 passer rating.

Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014.

{"question": "During the 1920s, the HMS Argenta vessel was used as a military base and prison ship for the holding of Irish Republicans by the British government as part of their internment strategy after Bloody Sunday. Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 internees, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result.  There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923. By February 1923, under the 1922 Special Powers Act the British were detaining 263 men on the Argenta, which was moored in Belfast Lough. This was supplemented with internment at other land based sites such as Larne workhouse, Belfast Prison and Derry Gaol. Together, both the ship and the workhouse alone held 542 men without trial at the highest internment population level during June 1923.

Let's list all the sites mentioned:\n   - HMS Argenta (ship-based)\n   - Larne workhouse (land-based)\n   - Belfast Prison (land-based)\n   - Derry Gaol (land-based)\n\n   These are the only sites explicitly named.\n\n5.

The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed. This success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at the peak there were 20,000 Wayuus under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. This enabled the rebels to take nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards took refuge in Riohacha and sent urgent messages to Maracaibo, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Cartagena, the latter responding by sending 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death. A battle between the two groups of Wayuus was fought at La Soledad. That and the arrival of the Spanish reinforcements caused the rebellion to fade away, but not before the Guajiro had regained much territory. Who gave the Wayuus firearms?", "answer": "English and Dutch smugglers", "original_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n\nThe passage states that \"Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish.\" This directly indicates that the Wayuus obtained firearms through smuggling operations conducted by English and Dutch traders.

The rebellious areas were effectively incorporated into Soviet Russia. However, Vladimir Lenin's desire to keep peace with Georgia at that time and eventual military failures of the rebels forced the Bolsheviks to distance themselves from the Ossetian struggle.

Does it mean:\n- How many yards did the interception travel? (i.e., the return)\n- Or how many yards did the interception itself cover (i.e., the length of the interception play)?\n\nBut the word \"intercept\" refers to the act of catching a pass that is being thrown, not the return. So, the interception itself is a moment when a player catches a thrown ball \u2014 that doesn't have a \"yardage\" in the sense of distance traveled.\n\nHowever, in football terminology, when we say \"returned an interception 50 yards for a touchdown,\" we mean the player caught the interception and then ran it back 50 yards \u2014 that's the yardage of the return.\n\nSo, the question \"how many yards did Ross intercept?\" is likely a misphrasing. It probably intends to ask: \"How many yards did Ross return the interception for?\"\n\nIn that case, the answer is 50 yards \u2014 as stated in the text.\n\nBut if we take \"intercept\" literally \u2014 how many yards did the interception cover? \u2014 that doesn't make sense. An interception is a play that happens at a certain point, and it doesn't have a yardage.

{"question": "Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat.

{"question": "The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed.

How many years did it take the tariff rate on imports to increase 19% after 1929?", "answer": "3", "original_reasoning": "Let's carefully analyze the question and the information provided.\n\nWe are asked:  \n**\"How many years did it take the tariff rate on imports to increase 19% after 1929?\"**\n\nFirst, interpret the key data:\n\n- The average tariff rate increased from **40.1% in 1929 to 59.1% in 1932**.\n- This is an increase of **19%** (from 40.1% to 59.1%).\n- The time period is from **1929 to 1932**, which is **3 years**.\n\nNow, the question says:  \n\"How many years did it take the tariff rate on imports to increase 19% after 1929?\"\n\nImportant note: The 19% increase in tariff rate (from 40.1% to 9.1% higher, i.e., 59.1%) happened **after 1929**, and it occurred over the period **1929 to 1932**, which is **3 years**.\n\nEven though the passage mentions other increases (e.g., in 1861, 1863\u20131866, 1920\u20131922), the specific 19% increase **after 1929** (as referenced in the text) is from 1929 to 1932.\n\nSo, we are not being asked about any other historical increases \u2014 only the one **after 1929** that increased by 19 percentage points (from 40.1% to 59.1%).\n\nWe are to find the number of years it took for this 19% increase to occur.\n\n- 1929 to 1930: 1 year  \n- 1930 to 1931: 2 years  \n- 1931 to 1932: 3 years  \n\nSo, it took **3 years** for the tariff rate to increase from 40.1% to 59.1% (a 19 percentage point increase), which is the 19% increase mentioned.\n\nNote: The phrase \"increase 19%\" could be ambiguous \u2014 does it mean a 19 percentage point increase or a 19% relative increase?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- 19% of 40.1% = 0.19 \u00d7 40.1 \u2248 7.62%\n- So a 19% relative increase would be 40.1 + 7.62 = 47.72%\n- But the actual increase is to 59.1%, which is a 19 percentage point increase (40.1 \u2192 59.1), not a 19% relative increase.\n\nThe passage says: \"increased from 40.1% in 1929 to 59.1% in 1932 (+19%)\"\n\nThis is ambiguous \u2014 but in context, it says \"increased from 40.1% to 59.1% (+19%)\", and since 59.1 - 40.1 = 19.0, it's clearly a **19 percentage point increase**, not a 19% relative increase.\n\nMoreover, the passage says: \"it was already consistently at high level between 1865 and 1913 (from 38% to 52%)\" \u2014 which is a 14 percentage point increase \u2014 so the use of \"+19%\" here is likely referring to the **absolute increase in percentage points**, not relative.\n\nTherefore, the 19% in the text refers to a **19 percentage point increase**, not a 19% relative increase.\n\nSo, the increase from 40.1% to 59.1% is a 19 percentage point rise, occurring over the period 1929 to 1932.\n\nThat is **3 years**.", "reasoning": "S0[1929:40.1%, 1932:59.1%] \u2192 S1[\u0394=59.1\u221240.1=19 pp] \u2192 S2[1932\u22121929=3 years]\u2713"}

The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno.

However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back Correll Buckhalter fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back Darren McFadden fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal. The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star defensive end Elvis Dumervil (who had 4 in the previous game against the Cleveland Browns). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6.

{"question": "Coming off their first loss in their last 8 games, the Patriots came to San Diego to face the 8-4 Chargers, who were on a three-game winning streak. After forcing the Chargers to punt, the Patriots put together a 17 play, 89-yard marathon drive to the Chargers 1-yard line, but on 3rd-and-goal Brady was sacked for a 7-yard loss and Shareece Wright blocked Gostkowski's 26-yard field goal attempt, but he was flagged for being offsides, and Gostkowski made a 22-yard field goal. The Chargers answered the Patriots on their next drive, marching 80 yards in 11 plays with Philip Rivers hitting Malcolm Floyd for a 15-yard touchdown to put the Chargers up 7-3. On the fourth play of the Patriots next drive, Brady threw a two-yard pass to LaFell, who was stripped by Jahleel Addae with Darrell Stuckey picking up the fumble and rumbling 53 yards for a touchdown and a 14-3 Chargers lead. The Patriots drove all the way to the Charges 4-yard line, but the Chargers defense made a stand and the Patriots settled for a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal, and the score was 14-6. After forcing a Chargers three-and-out, Bolden blockedMike Scifres' punt, knocking him out of the game, at the Chargers 25. Four plays later, Brady threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, cutting the deficit to 14-13. After another Chargers punt, the Patriots drove to the Chargers 18, but Brady was intercepted by Manti Te'o at the 4, concluding a sloppy, unimpressive, first half for both offenses. Both offenses came out just as bad in the second half, resulting in a combined five consecutive 3-and-outs. Midway through the third quarter, Devin McCourty intercepted Rivers at the Patriots 44 and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, but a helmet-to-helmet hit by Browner on Ladarius Green nullified the score. Replays showed Browner hit his shoulder, not his head, but the ruling was upheld. The break seemed to spur the Chargers to a score, as they reached Patriots territory but Rivers was intercepted by Akeem Ayers at the Patriots 30-yard line. The Patriots offense continued their cold streak by going three-and-out on their fourth straight drive, but their defense continued to shut down San Diego. A 16-yard punt return by Edelman set the Patriots up at their own 25. They marched 55 yards to the Chargers 20, and took the lead on a 38-yard Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriot a 16-14 lead midway through the fourth quarter. After the Chargers went three-and-out for the fourth time in five drives(the lone exception ending in an interception), Brady hit Edelman on the first play of the their next drive for a 69-yard catch-and-run touchdown. The extra point made the score 23-14, sealing another Patriots win. Despite the win, the Chargers showed that the Patriots offense was still prone to mistakes. Edelman was the star, with 8 catches for 141 yards and a touchdown. The Patriots defense had a great showing, holding the Chargers to just 216 total yards, sacking Philip Rivers four times, with an interception.

{"question": "According to the 2006 Canadian Census (0038.00 census tract), approximately 76% of the residents at Kensington Market are Canadian citizens. Of that 7%, 9% are under the age of 18. This means that 24% of Kensington Markets population is non-Canadian citizens, a figure that speaks to Kensington Markets character as a hub for multiculturalism. Furthermore, in 2011 the National Household Survey reported very similar data. Although the population accounted by citizenship status increased from 2006 and 2011, the percentage of those with Canadian citizenship versus those without the citizenship remained the same.  In 2006, 2800 residents reported that they were Canadian citizens whereas 870 residents reported they did not hold Canadian citizenship .

{"question": "Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat.

{"question": "In week seven, the Packers traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to face the 1-5 Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium. The Browns started off the contest with the ball at their own 45-yard line after Packers kicker Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds on the opening kickoff. The Browns couldn't manage to move the ball effectively on their first possession though failing to convert their first third down of the game and had to settle for a punt. After the punt the Packers took over at their own 14-yard line and ran the ball on ten of the eleven plays of their first drive, moving the ball all the way down to the Cleveland 32-yard line where backup running back Brandon Jackson came up a yard short on a third and three. The Packers offense stayed on the field and quarterback Aaron Rodgers attempted a quarterback sneak up the middle but the attempt failed to gain any yards and the ball was turned over on downs. Cleveland's second drive of the game was more successful than the previous, with the biggest gain of the drive coming on a 22-yard pass from quarterback Derek Anderson to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi who beat Packers cornerback Al Harris on a square in route. Harris also grabbed Massaquoi's face mask on the tackle and the Packers were penalized 15 yards for the infraction. The Browns managed to advance the ball down deep into the red zone, but the Packers defense held the Browns out of the end zone and forced them to settle for a 22-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter that hit the upright but deflected through to give the Browns an early 3-0 lead. On the Packers' next drive, Aaron Rodgers and company moved the ball down to the Cleveland 48-yard line with a short pass to Donald Lee, a 13-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 6-yard pass to Greg Jennings. The drive was capped off with a short right pass from Aaron Rodgers to linebacker turned tight end Spencer Havner. Havner pulled in the pass and ran down the right sideline 45 yards for a touchdown to claim a 7-3 Packers lead. The Browns then took over on offense trying to reclaim the lead from the Packers. After two incompletions and a 5-yard pass completion the Browns failed to reach the first down marker and looked to end the offensive series on a three and out. On the punt however, the Packers were penalized 5 yards for having 12 men on the field of play which gave the Browns a first down. The Browns still failed to capitalize on the Packers mistake by only gaining 4 yards on the next three plays and settled for another punt. The Packers offense took over again at their own 14. On first down, running back Ryan Grant rushed for 6 yards and 4 on second down, but tight end Donald Lee was flagged for holding on the second rushing attempt, moving the Packers back 10 yards. Lee made up for his mistake on the new play though, hauling in a 19-yard reception for a first down. On the next play, Rodgers dropped back to pass and hit Donald Driver in stride between two defenders. Driver accelerated down field past an oncoming safety and into the end zone for a 71-yard touchdown to increase the Packers lead to 14-3. The Browns offense took to the field to try to out-fox the Packers defense. On the sixth play of the drive though, quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in which he returned down to the Browns 15-yard line for a 25-yard return. Ryan Grant then rushed the ball for nine yards on second down to the Browns 3-yard line to set up first and goal at the three. After an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings, Ryan Grant rushed for 2 more yards on second down falling a yard short of the touchdown. Rodgers then passed to Donald Driver on third and one but the pass was incomplete. Fortunately, the Browns defender covering Driver was flagged for pass inference and the Packer were rewarded with a first and goal at the 1-yard line. After a Grant run for no gain and a John Kuhn rush for no gain, Ryan Grant then managed to break the goal line on third down to score a touchdown for the Packers extending the lead even more to 21-3. The Browns took over with less than a minute remaining in the half but managed to have to settle for one final hail Mary attempt into the end zone which was batted down incomplete to end the half with the Packers leading 21-3. After the half, the Packers started out with possession and managed to move the ball down to the Browns 37-yard line with multiple short yardage gains both passing and rushing. After an offensive pass interference penalty on Donald Lee, the Packers failed to convert on third and 20 and had to settle for a 55-yard field goal attempt on which kicker Mason Crosby missed wide left. The Browns then took over after the missed attempt and running back Jamal Lewis rushed for 4 yards on first and 4 on second down to set the Browns up with a 3rd and 2 on the Packers 47. On third down, Anderson dropped back to pass and threw a ball short right to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Charles Woodson immediately hit Cribbs knocking the ball out of his possession. The ball was recovered by the Packers at the Packers 48 by Packers linebacker Brandon Chillar. The Packers offense then got into another string of multiple rushing attempts in which was started out with a 15-yard carry by Grant.  Rodgers also completed a 16-yard pass to Donald Lee on the drive which stalled when a short pass to Ryan Grant on third down  and four only gained three yards down to the Browns 1-yard line. Crosby came onto the field and converted a chip shot field goal to extend the Packers lead to 24-3. The Browns managed to move the ball much more effectively than previous attempts on their corresponding drive moving the ball all the way down into the red zone. In the drive that in which extended into the fourth quarter, The Browns offense was held on four straight attempts inside the Packers four-yard line. The drive ended when the Browns choose to go for it on fourth down at the one, but the Anderson pass flew over wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi and out of the back of the end zone. The Packers then took over at their own 1-yard line and managed to move the ball 99 yards for another touchdown. The drive was highlighted by an 18-yard pass to Jennings, a 14-yard pass to Spencer Havner and a 19-yard scamper by Aaron Rodgers down to the Browns 39-yard line. Ryan Grant broke loose on the next play of the drive for 37 yards down the right sideline to the Browns 5-yard line. Rodgers then connected with James Jones in the lower left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown of the game, which extended the lead to 31-3. Both teams then continued to exchange rather meaningless possessions with the Packers offense now being run by backup quarterback Matt Flynn. The Packers final drive of the game started with 5:52 remaining on the clock and multiple rush attempts along with a Flynn pass to Jennings for 12 yards ran the clock down to 35 seconds. The Browns took over and rushed the ball once in which the game clock then expired to give the Packers their second successive victory, this time 31-3 over the Cleveland Browns. During the contest second-year tight end Jermichael Finley and fourth-string wide receiver Brett Swain both were removed for the game because of knee injuries.

{"question": "On Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete.

{"question": "Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \"Starving Time\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56. Local legend says that he loved Bermuda so much that he requested that his heart be buried there. A marker in Somers' Gardens in St. George's marks the approximate location where his heart was supposed to have been buried.

{"question": "Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Patriots stayed at home for a Week 4 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback.

{"question": "Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \"Starving Time\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56. Local legend says that he loved Bermuda so much that he requested that his heart be buried there. A marker in Somers' Gardens in St. George's marks the approximate location where his heart was supposed to have been buried. The remainder of his body was taken back to England and buried in his home hamlet of Whitchurch Canonicorum near to the town of Lyme Regis.

{"question": "The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season.

The Spanish failed to defeat the Chichimeca militarily and instituted a new policy called \"peace by purchase\" in which Catholic missionaries would be a major tool in pacifying hostile and semi-hostile Indians.  Indians were to be supplied with food and tools and resettled into towns. Missionaries, rather than the military, would take on most of the responsibility for integrating the Indians into Mexican and Christian society.

{"question": "In July 1449 Esen Tayisi  of the Mongols launched a large-scale, three-pronged invasion of China with his puppet khagan Toqtaq-Buqa. He personally advanced on Datong  in August. The eunuch official Wang Zhen, who dominated the Ming court, encouraged the 22-year-old Zhengtong Emperor to lead his own armies into battle against Esen. The size of Esen's army is unknown but a best guess puts it at some 20,000 men. The Ming army of about 500,000 was hastily assembled; its command was made up of 20 experienced generals and a large entourage of high-ranking civil officials, with Wang Zhen acting as field marshal. On August 3 Esen's army crushed a badly supplied Chinese army at Yanghe, just inside the Great Wall. The same day the Emperor appointed his half-brother Zhu Qiyu as regent. The next day he left Beijing for Juyong Pass. The objective was a short, sharp march west to Datong via the Xuanfu garrison, a campaign into the steppe and then a return to Beijing by a southerly route through Yuzhou. Initially the march was mired by heavy rain. At Juyong Pass the civil officials and generals wanted to halt and send the emperor back to Beijing, but their opinions were overruled by Wang Zhen. On August 16, the army came upon the corpse-strewn battlefield of Yanghe. When it reached Datong on August 18, reports from garrison commanders persuaded Wang Zhen that a campaign into the steppe would be too dangerous.

{"question": "The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal.

On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season.

{"question": "The Cincinnati Bengals entered their week ten matchup with the New York Giants reeling after four consecutive losses, separated by their week 8 bye week. Following their 3-1 start to the season, the Bengals had lost all momentum and fallen heavily in the AFC standings.Despite being heavy underdogs, the Bengals came out and grabbed the momentum of the football game early, scoring on their first possession of the game. Playing against a defense that Cincinnati receiver AJ Green remarked \" a lot of holes,\" earlier in the week, Green culminated Cincinnati's first possession with a fifty-six yard touchdown reception, beating a badly blown coverage on the play. The score marked Green's eighth straight contest with a touchdown reception, which tied him with former Bengal TJ Houshmandzadeh for second all-time in Bengals history.The ensuing Giants possession was unspectacular, with the Giants going three-and-out and being forced to punt the ball right back to Cincinnati. New York Giant punter Sean Weatherford looked to have gotten a spectacular punt away, which would have forced Cincinnati to start their possession inside their own twenty yard-line. However, a penalty on Giants cornerback Justin Tryon for intentionally leaving the field of play, rendered the punt moot, and forced the Giants to re-attempt the play. On the ensuing punt, Bengals cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones returned the ball sixty-eight yards to the Giants eleven yard line. The Bengals did not hesitate to take advantage of the large swing in field positioning, as second year quarterback Andy Dalton connected with receiver Andrew Hawkins for an eleven-yard touchdown strike on third-and-ten. The three play drive took only eighteen second off of the clock, and gave the Bengals a 14-0 advantage. The Giants would see a measure of momentum swing in their favor as following their ensuing possession, which resulted in a three-and-out from New York, Cincinnati receiver Brandon Tate would fumble Sean Weatherford's punt, giving the Giants possession of the football inside Cincinnati territory for the first time on the afternoon. The Giants would somewhat take advantage of the mistake, as they would turn the fumble into a twenty-three yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals would proceed to expand their lead further, putting together a fifteen play drive that took over seven minutes off of the clock and resulted in a twenty-eight yard field goal by Mike Nugent. The conversion put Cincinnati up by a score of 17-3 with time dwindling in the first half. The ensuing Giants possession would take all but eleven second of the 4:17 that remained in the opening half and would see Lawrence Tynes trotted out to convert on a thirty-one yard field goal at its finish. The points got the Giants back to within eleven points at the half, with the score 17-6 in favour of Cincinnati.The first five possessions coming out of the half, two of which ended in New York Giant turnovers, would not result in any points being scored by either team. However, following an Eli Manning interception, Cincinnati would be able to take advantage of the short field and pick up their third touchdown on the afternoon. The Bengals second three-play touchdown drive of the game was capped off by Andy Dalton hitting tight end Jermaine Gresham for a ten-yard receiving touchdown, making the score 24-6 in favour of Cincinnati.New York's next possession would result in Eli Manning firing a second straight interception. The result for Cincinnati would be the same, with Dalton culminating yet another three-play touchdown drive by hitting first-year receiver Mohamed Sanu for a ten-yard strike. The touchdown was Sanu's first receiving touchdown in the National Football League, though he had already thrown for a touchdown in Cincinnati's week 3 encounter with the Washington Redskins. The touchdown, also representing a career-high fourth on the afternoon for Andy Dalton, gave the Bengals their final points of the afternoon, and a 31-6 advantage.The rest of the game was largely uneventful, with both teams accepting the fate of the game as having already been determined. The Giants were able to put up their lone touchdown of the game following a thirteen play, ninety-eight yard possession that was capped by running back Ahmad Bradshaw punching the ball in from two yards away. The lone Giants touchdown of the afternoon would also be the last points put up, making the final score 31-13 Cincinnati.

{"question": "After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum.

{"question": "The Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks in their second game against the Green Bay Packers in an NFC North showdown, with a division title on the line for the Packers. After a scoreless first quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 15-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. However, the Packers scored three unanswered touchdowns on Aaron Rodgers' touchdown passes to James Jones. The defending league MVP completed 23 of 36 passes for 291 yards, along with the touchdown passes. Cutler completed 12 of 21 passes for 135 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a 72.5 passer rating, and was sacked four times. After the Packers scored their first touchdown on Rodgers' touchdown pass to Jones late in the first half, Cutler's pass intended for Devin Hester was intercepted by Casey Hayward, which then became an eight-yard touchdown pass. The Packers then opened the second half when Rodgers threw another touchdown pass to Jones. Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery was later flagged for pass interference, nullifying a touchdown pass, and the Bears had to resort to Olindo Mare-substituting for Robbie Gould-kicking a 34-yard field goal. On the Bears following drive, they went three-and-out, and on the punt return, Randall Cobb threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who fumbled the ball. Anthony Walters then recovered the ball, but the Bears failed to capitalize on the turnover, failing to gain a yard, and the team had to resort to Mare's second 34-yard field goal.

{"question": "Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic. The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27\u00a0May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck. In November 1939, the United States, who were taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies, amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort. The US started strategic planning to prepare for a full scale offensive against Germany. At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy and Germany as the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.

However, the Tripartite Pact\u2014specifically the formal, binding agreement among the three nations\u2014was signed on September 27, 1940, and marked the official formation of the Axis Powers as a tripartite alliance.\n\nWhile Japan, Italy, and Germany had individual alliances and mutual interests, the formal, collective Axis alliance (as recognized in historical records and the text) began with the signing of the Tripartite Pact in September 1940.

{"question": "Armenians have had a continuous documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene, of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136-1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the Lionheart, when he landed in Limassol.

{"question": "The Cambodian-Spanish War    was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai  soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales entered Cambodia through the city of Manila.Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia  failed, Ruiz and Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597.

{"question": "In Milan, in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation. The Italian army was forced to enter Milan with tanks and machine guns to face Bolsheviks and anarchists, who fought violently until 23 May when the army gained control of the city. Almost 50 people  were killed and over 800 people arrested. In September 1917, Russian soldiers in France began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied. In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the October Revolution of 1917, with the call going up for \"bread, land, and peace\". The Bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with Germany, the peace of Brest-Litovsk, despite its harsh conditions. In northern Germany, the German Revolution of 1918-1919 began at the end of October 1918. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The sailors' revolt, which then ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II.

It spanned from October 1918 to the end of 1919.\n\nTherefore, the duration is from 1918 to 1919 \u2014 a period of one year.\n\nEven though the revolution had a beginning in 1918 and an end in 1919, it lasted for one year (October 1918 to November 1919), so the time span is one year.", "reasoning": "S0[1918 end-Oct \u2192 1919] \u2192 S1[duration: 1 year]\u2713"}

In a refreshing change of pace, the Giants did not make any major mistakes and the defense forced three second half turnovers to hold off a potential Panther rally.  With RB Tiki Barber running well early, the Giants jumped out to a 10-0 lead, courtesy of a Jay Feely 32-yard field goal and a 28-yard touchdown from QB Eli Manning to WR Plaxico Burress.  The Giants surrendered the lead however as Panthers' backup quarterback Chris Weinke hit WR Drew Carter on a 36 yard strike and John Kasay kicked a field goal.  Right before halftime, Manning and the Giants went to the two-minute drill, driving right down the field.  The drive included an important third down completion from Manning to TE Jeremy Shockey.  Shockey then caught a two-yard rollout from Manning for a 17-10 halftime lead. The Giants took control in the third quarter as Weinke was intercepted for the first of three times, two by safety Gibril Wilson.  Feely added his second field goal making it 20-10.  After Wilson's second forced interception, the Giants extended the lead with some excellent running from Barber and RB Brandon Jacobs.

In 1271 the capital hillfort of T\u0113rvete was conquered, but Semigallians under the Duke Nameisis rebelled in 1279, and the Lithuanians under Traidenis defeated Livonian Order forces in the Battle of Aizkraukle. Duke Nameisis' warriors unsuccessfully attacked R\u012bga in 1280, in response to which around 14,000 crusaders besieged Turaida castle in 1281. To conquer the remaining Semigallian hillforts the Order's master Villekin of Endorpe built a castle called Heiligenberg right next to the T\u0113rvete castle in 1287. The same year the Semigallians made another attempt to conquer R\u012bga, but again failed to take it. On their return home Livonian knights attacked them, but were defeated at the Battle of Garoza, in which the Orders' master Villekin and at least 35 knights lost their lives. The new master of the Order Cuno of Haciginstein organised the last campaigns against the Semigallians in 1289 and 1290; the hillforts of Dobele, Rakte and Sidarbe were conquered and most of the Semigallian warriors joined the Samogitian and Lithuanian forces.

According to contemporary pro-Du\u0161an sources, evil advisors turned Uro\u0161 III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Du\u0161an of his inheritance. Uro\u0161 III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Du\u0161an had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uro\u0161 III ordered Du\u0161an to meet him.

{"question": "The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods. This engagement set the pattern for most Marine contacts with hostile forces in the Dominican Republic.

It resulted in the defeat and annexation of the Principality of Wales, and the other last remaining independent Welsh principalities, by Edward I, King of England. By the 13th century Wales was divided between native Welsh principalities and the territories of the Anglo-Norman Marcher lords. The leading principality was Gwynedd whose princes had gained control of the greater part of the country, making the other remaining Welsh princes their vassals, and had taken the title Prince of Wales. Although English monarchs had made several attempts to seize control of the native Welsh territories, it was not until Edward's war of conquest against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd  of 1277 to 1283 that this was achieved on a lasting basis. In two campaigns, in 1277 and 1282/1283 respectively, Edward first significantly reduced the territory of the Principality of Wales and then completely overran it, as well as the other remaining Welsh principalities. Most of the conquered territory was retained as a royal fief, and these lands subsequently became, by custom, the territorial endowment of the heir to the English throne with the title Prince of Wales.

{"question": "The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the Teutonic Order of German crusading knights which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century. Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially converted to  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights. The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia , an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats.

{"question": "With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

{"question": "(2012 Green Bay Packers season)The Texans came into their first ever appearance on Sunday Night Football facing playoff favorites Green Bay, who had shockingly started the season 2-3, one of those losses ending in controversy.  And coming off another disappointing loss to Indianapolis the week before, the Green Bay Packers took out all of their early season frustrations out on the Texans at Reliant Stadium, and at the same time, reestablished themselves as the team to beat in the NFC.  Aaron Rodgers tore up the Texans defense with 6 touchdown passes, and the Packers as the Texans dropped to 5-1 and 0-1 on Sunday Night Football. On the second drive of the game, Aaron Rodgers threw a touchdown to James Jones to make it 7-0. A few drives later it was 14-0 on a Rodgers to Jones touchdown. Houston scored 1 drive later on an Arian Foster touchdown run to make it 14-7. Then Rodgers hit Jordy Nelson to make it 21-7. Before the half ended, Houston got a field goal to make it 21-10 at the half. Mason Crosby made a field goal but was nullified by Houston being offsides. Rodgers then hit Nelson to make it28-10. Foster scored again to make it 28-17. On the next drive, Rodgers found Tom Crabtree to make it 35-17. After a Texan interception, Rodgers found James Jones again to make it 42-17.

{"question": "With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

A year later, Arsenal appeared in the FA Cup final for the second time in a row, defeating Aston Villa F.C. 4-0 in the 2015 FA Cup Final and becoming the most successful club in the tournaments history with 12 titles, a record which Manchester United would tie the following season. Arsenal later won the 2016-17 FA Cup for a record 13th time, defeating Chelsea 2-1 in the 2017 FA Cup Final and once more becoming the outright leader in terms of FA Cups won. The victory also saw Wenger become the first manager in English football history to win seven FA Cups. However, in that same season, Arsenal finished in the fifth position in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996. After another unspectacular league season the following year, Wenger announced his departure from the club on 20 April 2018, after 22 years as manager. His decision was met by responses of praise throughout English and world football from many pundits and former players, who also thanked him for developing them as people. His final home match in charge was a 5-0 win over Burnley where his entrance was met to a standing ovation by supporters. The final match under the Wenger era was a 1-0 away victory against Huddersfield. By how many points did Arsenal win Wenger's last home game?", "answer": "5", "original_reasoning": "Let's carefully analyze the information provided in the question.\n\nThe passage states:\n\n- Wenger's final home match in charge was a 5-0 win over Burnley.\n- The final match under the Wenger era was a 1-0 away victory against Huddersfield.\n\nWe are asked: **By how many points did Arsenal win Wenger's last home game?**\n\nImportant points:\n\n- The question is asking for the **point difference** in Wenger's last home game.\n- The match in question is the **final home game** under Wenger \u2014 a 5-0 win over Burnley.\n- In football (soccer), points are awarded as follows:\n  - Win = 3 points\n  - Draw = 1 point\n  - Loss = 0 points\n\nHowever, the question is not asking for the point total or the number of points Arsenal earned. It is asking: **\"By how many points did Arsenal win\"** \u2014 which could be interpreted as the **point difference** between Arsenal and the opponent.\n\nBut in football, teams don't \"win by X points\" in the sense of a point gap \u2014 that term is used in leagues to describe the gap between teams in the standings (e.g., Arsenal is 3 points ahead of Chelsea). However, in a match, the result is expressed in terms of **goal difference**, not points.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"by how many points\" in a match context is **ambiguous** and **not standard**. In football, we say a team wins by a certain number of **goals** (e.g., won by 5 goals), not points.\n\nAdditionally, the passage says the match was a **5-0 win** \u2014 so the scoreline is 5-0.\n\nTherefore, the **goal difference** is 5 (Arsenal scored 5, Hull scored 0), so they won by 5 goals.\n\nBut the question says \"**by how many points**\" \u2014 and this is a misnomer. In football, we don't say a team wins by 5 points \u2014 we say they win by 5 goals.\n\nMoreover, the passage does not provide any information about the **league standings** or **point totals** for the teams involved in the match (e.g., Burnley or Arsenal's points in the league), nor does it mention any point gap between Arsenal and Burnley after the match.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"by how many points\" is likely a **misstatement** \u2014 it should be \"by how many goals\".\n\nBut let's double-check: is there any mention of points in the match result?\n\nNo. The only numbers given are the score: 5-0.\n\nAlso, the question says: \"By how many points did Arsenal win Wenger's last home game?\"\n\nThis implies a **point gap** \u2014 which in football is only meaningful in a league context (e.g., Arsenal is 3 points ahead of second place). But the match itself \u2014 a 5-0 win \u2014 is a result, not a league position.\n\nThus, there is **no point difference** between teams in a match \u2014 points are awarded per match, not per game won by a margin.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \"by how many points\" is **not applicable** in this context.\n\nBut perhaps the question is asking for the **goal difference**, and mistakenly used \"points\".\n\nGiven that the match ended 5-0, and it's a win, the **goal difference** is 5.\n\nIf we interpret \"by how many points\" as a misstatement for \"by how many goals\", then the answer would be 5.\n\nBut if we take \"points\" literally \u2014 in football \u2014 teams don't win a match by points; they win by goals.\n\nMoreover, the passage does not give any point totals for the teams \u2014 only the score.\n\nTherefore, the only reasonable interpretation is that the question meant: **by how many goals did Arsenal win the match?**\n\nAnswer: 5 goals.\n\nThus, the final answer is 5.", "reasoning": "S0[5-0 win] \u2192 S1[goal difference: 5]\u2713 \u27f9 S2[interpret \"points\" as \"goals\" due to context] \u2192 S3[5]"}

{"question": "Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

{"question": "In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, bringing back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary was under Ottoman control. As part of a Franco-Ottoman alliance , French troops were supplied to the Ottomans in Hungary: a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543-1544 and attached to the Ottoman Army. In August 1543, the Ottoman succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom The siege would be followed by the capture of the Hungarian coronation city of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in September 1543. Other cities that were captured during this campaign are Sikl\u00f3s and Szeged in order to better protect Buda. However, continuous delay of the push toward the west, because of the siege of these fortresses, meant that the Ottomans could not launch any new offensive against Austria. From 1548 to the end of the war, a Habsburg Spanish infantry tercio which had fought in the Schmalkaldic War, led by Maestre de campo Bernardo de Aldana, was detached in Hungary to fight against John Z\u00e1polya's supporters on behalf of Ferdinand.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria.

{"question": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.

{"question": "Joaqu\u00edn de Montserrat was named viceroy of New Spain early in 1760. The transfer of power was made September 19, 1760 in Otumba, and his formal entry into Mexico City was October 6, 1760. Among his immediate and most important concerns was the organization of a true colonial army. As he passed through Puebla he reviewed a battalion of militia formed of Negroes and Mulattoes. Their arms were very irregular, and the new viceroy made a formal request to Spain for new rifles to arm them. In 1761 there was an epidemic of smallpox that principally attacked the Indians. Estimates were 14,600 dead in Mexico City and up to 80,000 in Puebla. The government nearly emptied its coffers  to provide what palliative assistance was possible. Viceroy Montserrat took economy measures, ordered the collection of back taxes, and prohibited hoarding of foodstuffs and merchandise. On November 20, 1761, Mayas under Jacinto Canek rose in rebellion in Cisteil, Yucatan. Canek was captured, and on December 14, 1761 he was tortured and quartered in the plaza of Valladolid. Other disasters during Montserrat's term of office included a major flood in Guanajuato that paralyzed the operation of the silver mines , and another epidemic  that caused many deaths . He also had to send military assistance to Sonora, where a revolt of Pimas and Seris had broken out against their maltreatment by the Spanish colonists. The rebels had killed the garrisons of two presidios and the governor before escaping to the mountains, where they were finally subdued.

{"question": "In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion.

Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, cuimhnig\u00ed Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh . The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October.

{"question": "The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \"flex scheduling\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \"finesse team\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \"LH\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs.

{"question": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.

{"question": "During the Mexican War of Independence from Spain  the Yaqui did not participate on either side. It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes.  The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader.  Banderas managed to get the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexican government.  Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo.  This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns.  After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as captain-general of the Yaqui town, and was given a salary. In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands.  In 1832 Banderas renewed the war against the Mexican authorities, in cooperation with Dolores Guti\u00e9rrez, a chief of the Opata people.

{"question": "On 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from the city of Istanbul. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Ni\u0161 to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death.

After driving to their own 38-yard-line, Philadelphia got the break they needed, with Bradford connecting with Riley Cooper for a 62-yard score. This cut the Redskins' lead to only 7 points, as Sturgis missed the extra point. Washington advanced the ball only 9 yards before punting back to the Eagles, who got the ball at their own 29-yard-line. Two Redskins penalties moved the ball 29 yards, and a 10-yard Bradford pass was caught by tight end Brent Celek to tie the game at 13-13. The Redskins retaliated by immediately getting into Eagles territory, courtesy of a 43-yard bomb from Kirk Cousins to rookie receiver Rashad Ross. Another rookie receiver, Jamison Crowder, got them inside the 20. From there, Hopkins kicked the ball through the uprights from 33 yards out, allowing Washington to regain its 16-13 advantage. The Redskins were quickly back in business after an Eagles punt, and now had a chance to go up by two scores, but Jordan Reed fumbled in Eagles territory to end the third quarter. Three plays later, Bradford burned the Redskins secondary on another deep ball, this one 39 yards to veteran wide receiver Miles Austin. More importantly, the Eagles took their first lead of the game, 20-16. The Redskins remained scoreless in the second half, punting from the Eagles' 35-yard-line instead of attempting a 53-yard field goal. The Eagles were barely able to cross midfield before punting back to Washington. With under 9 minutes remaining, they needed to regain some offensive momentum, but could not, going three-and-out. However, they were able to get a defensive stop, forcing the Eagles to go three-and-out as well. Alfred Morris runs of 16 and 13 yards got the offense rolling, and Pierre Gar&#231;on catches of 14 and 12 yards helped get Washington down to the Eagles' 4-yard-line with 35 seconds left. Cousins threw one incomplete pass to Crowder before connecting with Garcon for the game-winning touchdown and the 23-20 win. It was the second game-winning drive of Cousins' career, the first being Week 14 of the 2012 season against the Baltimore Ravens, when he entered the game in relief of the injured Robert Griffin III. This win was also Cousins' first division win, after previously going 0-5 against the Cowboys, Giants, and Eagles. With the win the Redskins moved to 2-2 for the season. Cousins threw zero interceptions for the second consecutive home game, a first in his career, and the Redskins defense did not allow a 40-yard rusher for the second straight week.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration.

Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.

{"question": "Some economic historians have observed that Standard Oil was in the process of losing its monopoly at the time of its breakup in 1911. Although Standard had 90 percent of American refining capacity in 1880, by 1911 that had shrunk to between 60 and 65 percent, due to the expansion in capacity by competitors. Numerous regional competitors (such as Pure Oil in the East, Texaco and Gulf Oil in the Gulf Coast, Cities Service Company and Sun Oil in the Midcontinent, Union Oil in California, and Royal Dutch Shell overseas) had organized themselves into competitive vertically integrated oil companies, the industry structure pioneered years earlier by Standard itself. In addition, demand for petroleum products was increasing more rapidly than the ability of Standard to expand. The result was that although in 1911 Standard still controlled most production in the older regions of the Appalachian Basin (78 percent share, down from 92 percent in 1880), Lima-Indiana (90 percent, down from 95 percent in 1906), and the Illinois Basin (83 percent, down from 100 percent in 1906), its share was much lower in the rapidly expanding new regions that would dominate U.S. oil production in the 20th century.

{"question": "The Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks in their second game against the Green Bay Packers in an NFC North showdown, with a division title on the line for the Packers. After a scoreless first quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 15-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. However, the Packers scored three unanswered touchdowns on Aaron Rodgers' touchdown passes to James Jones. The defending league MVP completed 23 of 36 passes for 291 yards, along with the touchdown passes. Cutler completed 12 of 21 passes for 135 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a 72.5 passer rating, and was sacked four times. After the Packers scored their first touchdown on Rodgers' touchdown pass to Jones late in the first half, Cutler's pass intended for Devin Hester was intercepted by Casey Hayward, which then became an eight-yard touchdown pass. The Packers then opened the second half when Rodgers threw another touchdown pass to Jones. Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery was later flagged for pass interference, nullifying a touchdown pass, and the Bears had to resort to Olindo Mare-substituting for Robbie Gould-kicking a 34-yard field goal. On the Bears following drive, they went three-and-out, and on the punt return, Randall Cobb threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who fumbled the ball. Anthony Walters then recovered the ball, but the Bears failed to capitalize on the turnover, failing to gain a yard, and the team had to resort to Mare's second 34-yard field goal. However, the Packers would hang on to defeat Chicago 21-13, clinching the NFC North. With the Bears' sixth straight loss to the Packers in the rivalry, the Bears dropped to 8-6.

The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats. How many years after rats were observed building nests in trees did an outbreak of plague occur that was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India?", "answer": "12", "original_reasoning": "**Reasoning:**\n\nWe are asked to find the number of years between the year when rats were observed building nests in trees and the year when an outbreak of plague occurred that was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India.\n\nFrom the passage:\n\n- Rats were observed building nests in trees **two feet across** in the year **1731**.\n- The outbreak of plague attributed to infected rats from ships arriving from India occurred in the year **1743**.\n\nNow, calculate the difference:\n\n1743 - 1731 = 12 years\n\nSo, 12 years after the observation of rats building large nests in trees, the plague outbreak occurred.\n\nNote: The passage does not state that the plague outbreak happened *immediately* after the rat nesting observation, but it does state both events occurred in the years 1731 and 1743, respectively, and the plague was linked to rats from ships.\n\nTherefore, the time between the observation (1731) and the plague (1743) is 12 years.", "reasoning": "S0[1731: rats nest in trees] \u2192 S1[1743: plague from infected rats] \u2192 S2[1743\u22961731=12]\u2713"}

{"question": "In April 1543 Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, bringing back Bran and other forts so that much of Hungary was under Ottoman control. As part of a Franco-Ottoman alliance , French troops were supplied to the Ottomans in Hungary: a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543-1544 and attached to the Ottoman Army. In August 1543, the Ottoman succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom The siege would be followed by the capture of the Hungarian coronation city of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in September 1543. Other cities that were captured during this campaign are Sikl\u00f3s and Szeged in order to better protect Buda. However, continuous delay of the push toward the west, because of the siege of these fortresses, meant that the Ottomans could not launch any new offensive against Austria. From 1548 to the end of the war, a Habsburg Spanish infantry tercio which had fought in the Schmalkaldic War, led by Maestre de campo Bernardo de Aldana, was detached in Hungary to fight against John Z\u00e1polya's supporters on behalf of Ferdinand.

{"question": "During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.

The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe.

The massacre sparked protests from the Silesian Polish miners, including a general strike of about 140,000 workers, and caused the First Silesian Uprising against German control of Upper Silesia. The miners demanded the local government and police become ethnically mixed to include both Germans and Poles. About 21,000 Germans soldiers of the Weimar Republic's Provisional National Army , with about 40,000 troops held in reserve, quickly put down the uprising. The army's reaction was harsh; and about 2,500 Poles were either hanged or executed by firing squad for their parts in the violence. Some 9,000 ethnic Poles sought refuge in the Second Polish Republic, taking along their family members.

The Polish police were not present in significant numbers in the region at that time, and the Polish population was largely under German administrative and military control.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October.

The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis, a central focus of the wider European debt crisis, plunged the economy into a sharp downturn, with Real gross domestic product GDP growth rates of \u22120.3% in 2008, \u22124.3% in 2009, \u22125.5% in 2010, \u22129.1% in 2011, \u22127.3% in 2012 and \u22123.2% in 2013. In 2011, the countrys government debt reached \u20ac356 billion (172% of nominal GDP). After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector involvement, Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to \u20ac280 billion (137% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2012. Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7% in 2014\u2014after 6 years of economic decline\u2014but contracted by 0.3% in 2015 and by 0.2% in 2016.

However, the duration of the war in Europe (including Greece's involvement) is generally considered to be from 1939 to 1945, which is 6 years.\n\nGreece was involved in the war as a belligerent (fighting on the side of the Allies), particularly during the German invasion of Greece in 1940\u20131941, and the subsequent occupation. However, the overall war period (1939\u20131945) is the timeframe referenced.\n\nTherefore, the war devastated Greece's economy over the span of 6 years.", "reasoning": "S0[1939\u20131945] \u2192 S1[1945\u22961939=6]\u2713"}
{"question": "at the Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia The Falcons welcomed the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers to town. The Falcons beat the Steelers in overtime, 41-38. The Falcons recovered a Steelers fumble after they punted to start the game. On the next play Michael Vick hit Alge Crumpler for a 22-yard touchdown pass. It was the first of what would be a career-high four touchdown pass game for Vick. After Steelers' kicker Jeff Reed kicked a 28-yard, the Steelers' defense held and forced the Falcons to give up the ball again when Steelers' safety Troy Polamalu intercepted Vick. Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hit Georgia native and Steelers' receiver Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown pass to give the Steelers a 10-7 lead after one quarter of play. On the next Steelers' drive, Ben Roethlisberger found Heath Miller for a 1-yard touchdown pass to give the Steelers a 17-7 lead.

{"question": "A 27-13 victory over the Carolina Panthers boosted New York to 7-6 and an inside track to an NFC Wildcard spot.  In a refreshing change of pace, the Giants did not make any major mistakes and the defense forced three second half turnovers to hold off a potential Panther rally.  With RB Tiki Barber running well early, the Giants jumped out to a 10-0 lead, courtesy of a Jay Feely 32-yard field goal and a 28-yard touchdown from QB Eli Manning to WR Plaxico Burress.  The Giants surrendered the lead however as Panthers' backup quarterback Chris Weinke hit WR Drew Carter on a 36 yard strike and John Kasay kicked a field goal.  Right before halftime, Manning and the Giants went to the two-minute drill, driving right down the field.  The drive included an important third down completion from Manning to TE Jeremy Shockey.  Shockey then caught a two-yard rollout from Manning for a 17-10 halftime lead. The Giants took control in the third quarter as Weinke was intercepted for the first of three times, two by safety Gibril Wilson.  Feely added his second field goal making it 20-10.  After Wilson's second forced interception, the Giants extended the lead with some excellent running from Barber and RB Brandon Jacobs.  A slip-screen to Barber from Manning, pushed the ball inside the five and Manning then hit WR David Tyree on a three-yard touchdown to put Big Blue up 17.  Although Weinke threw for over 400 yards, the defense made the key plays in critical moments.  Rookie DB Kevin Dockery recorded his second interception of the season late in the game.

For the first time since the declaration of independence from Spain in 1581, the Dutch were reunited with the Southern Netherlands in a constitutional monarchy, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The union lasted just 15\u00a0years. In 1830, a revolution in the southern half of the country led to the de facto independence of the new state of Belgium. The bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800, and its territorial possessions were nationalized as the Dutch East Indies.Anglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of Singapore, which had been ceded to the British East India Company in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan's predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded Malacca and their bases in India to the British, and recognized the British claim to Singapore. In return, the British handed over Bencoolen and agreed not to sign treaties with rulers in the \"islands south of the Straits of Singapore\".

He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament.

{"question": "The Vikings' twelfth game was an interconference duel with the Bills inside their dome and the first home game for interim head coach Leslie Frazier. On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak.  In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by RB Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard TD run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard TD pass to TE David Nelson.

{"question": "From the time of its start until the approach of World War II, the First World War was called simply the World War or the Great War and thereafter the First World War or World War I. At the time, it was also sometimes called \"the war to end war\" or \"the war to end all wars\" due to its then-unparalleled scale and devastation. In Canada, Maclean's magazine in October 1914 wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\" During the interwar period , the war was most often called the World War and the Great War in English-speaking countries. The term \"First World War\" was first used in September 1914 by the German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'\u00a0.. will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" citing a wire service report in The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914. After the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the terms World War I or the First World War became standard, with British and Canadian historians favouring the First World War, and Americans World War I. In the introduction to his book, Waterloo in 100 Objects, historian Gareth Glover states: \"This opening statement will cause some bewilderment to many who have grown up with the appellation of the Great War firmly applied to the 1914-18 First World War. But to anyone living before 1918, the title of the Great War was applied to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars in which Britain fought France almost continuously for twenty-two years from 1793 to 1815.\" In 1911, the historian John Holland Rose published a book titled William Pitt and the Great War.

The passage specifies that Haeckel, a German biologist and philosopher, used the term in September 1914, and it was in reference to what would become the First World War. Although the term \"World War\" was commonly used in the early 20th century, the specific phrase \"first world war\" was introduced by Haeckel in that period.\n\nIt is important to note that while the term \"Great War\" was widely used at the time, the phrase \"first world war\" as a designation was first coined by Haeckel.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria.

{"question": "After World War II, amateur radio operators in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. \"The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society\" was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to \"The VHF Teletype Society\" and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSWs test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \"The RTTY Society of Southern California\" publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.

On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang.

{"question": "After World War II, amateur radio operators in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. \"The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society\" was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to \"The VHF Teletype Society\" and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSWs test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \"The RTTY Society of Southern California\" publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.

{"question": "The rebellion was ignited by the tax situation, where Eric showed arrogance by not negotiating with the four Estates of the Swedish realm at a Diet. In the summer of 1434, enraged miners and peasants burned the castle of Borgan\u00e4s near Borl\u00e4nge. The tension spread, causing several assaults on castles across the country. Nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson with mining interests in the Bergslagen area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army. Negotiations with Eric took place in Vadstena in August 1434, but were unsuccessful. In January 1435 Engelbrekt summoned representatives from the four Estates to a Diet in Arboga, which later has been called the first Riksdag of the Estates. Engelbrekt was elected Captain of the Swedish realm. The antagonism abated when Eric promised changes for the better. However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm, where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city. A certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the Nobility and Clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 had risen to the position of Riksh\u00f6vitsman. Neither dared remove Engelbrekt completely because of his strong support among the two lower Estates . However, Engelbrekt fell sick and became less active. In a twist of fate highly beneficial to Knutsson, Engelbrekt was assassinated on May 4 by M\u00e5ns Bengtsson , the cause being an unrelated personal conflict. Consequently, Knutsson won the power struggle . A man named Erik Puke attempted to rally Engelbrekt's old supporters in the Pukefejden, but it was too late.

{"question": "The Bears opened the season at home against the Buffalo Bills, who had a record of 6-10 in 2013. Entering the game, the Bears were 54-35-5 in season openers, the most wins of any team, and they had not lost an opening game since 2009, the most in the NFC and second-most in the NFL behind the New England Patriots. The Bears were 7-4 against the Bills, with their last meeting being a 22-19 victory in Toronto in 2010, while winning 40-7 in the last game between the two at Soldier Field; the Bears had won all five meetings between the two in Chicago. When comparing the two teams in 2013 statistically, the Bears had the advantage in three offensive categories (points scored, total offense, and passing offense), while the Bills had the second-best rushing offense, compared to the Bears' 16th-ranked rushing game. On defense, the Bears were outmatched in all three categories (total defense, rushing defense, and passing defense), but are one spot higher than Buffalo in turnover ratio (+5 to +3). Scout.com's Jeremy Stoltz writes that one of the players the Bears must contain is the defensive tackle duo of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus, who had a combined 139 total tackles, 18.0 sacks and two forced fumbles during 2013. While the Bears' offensive line boasted the fourth-least sacks, none of the five starters played in the preseason. As a result, to combat the rush, the Bears need Jay Cutler to release the ball quickly. For the Bears' defense, Stoltz stated all the Bears needed to do was stop Buffalo's running backs Fred Jackson and C. J. Spiller, as the Bills had the second-best rushing attack in the league. The Bears were favored to win by seven points, the third-largest spread of the week. Matt Fort&#233;, Charles Tillman, and Robbie Gould were the captains for the game. David Fales, Kelvin Hayden, Tony Fiammetta, Khaseem Greene, Charles Leno, Jr., David Bass and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and elected to kick. After Buffalo punted, Chicago scored on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, which the Bills retaliated with E. J. Manuel's two-yard touchdown run. On the Bears' first drive of the second quarter, Brandon Marshall fumbled, with linebacker Preston Brown recovering; the Bills would score on Dan Carpenter's 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler was intercepted by former Bear Corey Graham after Bennett did not \"turn to look for the ball in time\", with the Bills again capitalizing on the takeaway, with Manuel's seven-yard touchdown pass to Spiller, and the half ended with Buffalo leading 17-7. On the Bears' first possession of the third quarter, Gould kicked a five-yard field goal, and on the Bills' first drive of the half, Chris Conte read a pass intended for Marquise Goodwin, stepping in front of the pass to intercept the ball. On Chicago's ensuing drive, the offense rallied to tie the score on Cutler's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove from their own six-yard line to reach the Buffalo 34, but Cutler's forced pass intended for Bennett was intercepted by Kyle Williams; Carpenter would kick a 33-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Gould's 37-yarder. The Bills would kneel to end regulation with a 20-20 score. After the Bears went three-and-out, the Bills started on their own 22-yard line, but drove to the Bears' 39. On the next play, Jackson found a hole in the line of scrimmage, getting past Lance Briggs. Conte reached Jackson at the 20-yard line, but was stiff-armed; Conte attempted to tackle again, but was knocked down, with Jackson being pushed out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays later, Carpenter kicked the game-winning 27-yard field goal. Four of the Bears' offensive starters suffered injuries during the game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) did not play after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, \"It was a play where it's the end of the game - I've got to get the ball out or something. If I hit him, it's a field goal no matter what, so I've got to try and get the ball out. It's a desperation play where I've got to try and punch the ball or something.\".

Indianapolis scored first on a 6-yard touchdown run by running back Dominic Rhodes. The second quarter, though, was taken over by the Jets as they tied the game on QB Chad Pennington's 33-yard touchdown pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery, and took the lead on RB Kevan Barlow's 1-yard touchdown run. The Colts tied the game just before halftime on a 2-yard touchdown run by rookie RB Joseph Addai.

Spanish captains Lezcano and Lorenzo Zafra visited the coast of Northern Africa to identify possible locations for the Spanish to overtake, and Melilla was identified as a prime candidate. Melilla was, however, in the Portuguese zone of influence under the terms of the 1479 Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz. At Tordesillas in 1494, King John II of Portugal, the Portuguese ruler agreed to make an exception and permitted the Spanish to attempt the conquest of Melilla. The duke sent Pedro Estopi\u00f1\u00e1n\u00a0 who conquered the city virtually without a fight in 1497, as internal conflicts had depleted it of troops, and its defenses were weakened. The Wattasid ruler Muhammad al-Shaykh sent a detachment of cavalrymen to retake control of the city, but they were repulsed by the guns of the Spanish ships. What happened second: The Conquest of Melilla or Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz?", "answer": "The Conquest of Melilla", "original_reasoning": "To determine what happened second \u2014 the Conquest of Melilla or the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz \u2014 we must examine the chronological sequence of events described.\n\nFirst, the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz (1479): This treaty established a division of influence between Spain and Portugal in the Atlantic and North African territories. It placed Melilla under Portuguese influence, meaning that Spain was not allowed to claim or conquer it under the terms of the treaty.\n\nThen, the Spanish plans for the conquest began after the Fall of Granada in 1492. Spanish captains Lezcano and Lorenzo Zafra conducted reconnaissance along the North African coast, identifying Melilla as a strategic target.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) is mentioned as the point where King John II of Portugal agreed to an exception, permitting Spain to attempt the conquest of Melilla \u2014 despite the earlier terms of the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz.\n\nTherefore, the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz (1479) predates the Conquest of Melilla (1497). The Spanish attempt to conquer Melilla occurred after the Treaty of Tordesillas, which allowed for the exception.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n1. Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz (1479) \u2014 establishes Portuguese control over Melilla.\n2. Spanish reconnaissance and planning after 1492.\n3. Treaty of Tordesivals (1494) \u2014 allows Spanish attempt.\n4. Conquest of Melilla (1497).\n\nThus, the Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz happened first, and the Conquest of Melilla happened second.", "reasoning": "S0[1479: Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovaz \u2192 Portuguese control] \u2192 S1[1492: Fall of Granada \u2192 Spanish planning] \u2192 S2[1494: Treaty of Tordesillas \u2192 exception granted] \u2192 S3[1497: Conquest of Melilla \u2192 Spanish capture] \u27f9 S4[\u229b 1497>1479] \u22b3 Conquest second"}
{"question": "In 1183, the Taira loss at the Battle of Kurikara was so severe that they found themselves, several months later, under siege in Kyoto, with Yoshinaka approaching the city from the north and Yukiie from the east. Both Minamoto leaders had seen little or no opposition in marching to the capital and now forced the Taira to flee the city. Taira no Munemori, head of the clan since his father Kiyomori's death, led his army, along with the young Emperor Antoku and the Imperial regalia, to the west. The cloistered emperor Go-Shirakawa defected to Yoshinaka. Go-Shirakawa then issued a mandate for Yoshinaka to \"join with Yukiie in destroying Munemori and his army\".:293-294 In 1183, Yoshinaka once again sought to gain control of the Minamoto clan by planning an attack on Yoritomo, while simultaneously pursuing the Taira westward. The Taira set up a temporary Court at Daaifu in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. They were forced out soon afterwards by local revolts instigated by Go-Shirakawa, and moved their Court to Yashima. The Taira were successful in beating off an attack by Yoshinaka's pursuing forces at the Battle of Mizushima.:295-296 Yoshinaka conspired with Yukiie to seize the capital and the Emperor, possibly even establishing a new Court in the north. However, Yukiie revealed these plans to the Emperor, who communicated them to Yoritomo. Betrayed by Yukiie, Yoshinaka took command of Kyoto and, at the beginning of 1184, set fire to the H\u014dj\u016bjidono, taking the Emperor into custody. Minamoto no Yoshitsune arrived soon afterwards with his brother Noriyori and a considerable force, driving Yoshinaka from the city. After fighting his cousins at the bridge over the Uji, Yoshinaka made his final stand at Awazu, in \u014cmi Province. He was defeated by Yoshitsune, and killed while attempting to flee.:296-297. Who died later, Kiyomori or Munemori?", "answer": "Munemori", "original_reasoning": "**Reasoning:**\n\nWe are asked to determine who died later: Kiyomori or Munemori.\n\nFrom the passage:\n\n- \"Taira no Munemori, head of the clan since his father Kiyomori's death\" \u2014 this indicates that Kiyomori died before Munemori became head of the clan.\n\n- The text states that Kiyomori died, and Munemori succeeded him as head of the Taira clan.\n\nNow, we need to determine the timeline of their deaths.\n\n- The events described take place in 1183\u20131184. The Taira are described as being under siege, fleeing Kyoto, and fighting in battles like Awazu in 1184.\n\n- The passage says: \"Taira no Munemori, head of the clan since his father Kiyomori's death\" \u2014 this confirms that Kiyomori died before Munemori took leadership.\n\n- The final events of the narrative \u2014 the Battle of Awazu in 1184 \u2014 result in Yoshinaka being defeated and killed. Yoshinaka was a Taira leader, and he died in 1184.\n\n- However, the question is not about Yoshinaka, but about **Kiyomori** and **Munemori**.\n\n- There is no mention of Kiyomori's death in the passage after 1183, but the text says he died, and Munemori succeeded him.\n\n- The key point is that Munemori is described as leading the Taira in 1183\u20131184, and the Taira are fighting in battles during this time.\n\n- Since Kiyomori died before Munemori became head, and Munemori is active in 1183\u20131184, we can infer that Kiyomori died earlier \u2014 likely in the years preceding 1183, when Munemori took over.\n\n- There is no indication that Munemori died during the events described (1183\u20131184), and in fact, he is leading the Taira through the battles, including the Battle of Awazu, where Yoshinaka is killed \u2014 but Munemori is not mentioned as being killed.\n\n- The passage does not state that Munemori died. In fact, he is the one leading the Taira westward, and the Taira are fleeing, suggesting he was still active.\n\n- Therefore, Kiyomori died earlier (before 1183), and Munemori lived through 1183\u20131184, surviving the battles.\n\nThus, **Kiyomori died before Munemori**, so **Munemori died later** \u2014 assuming he lived beyond 1184.\n\nBut is there any evidence that Munemori died?\n\nThe passage says: \"Yoshinaka.. made his final stand at Awazu.. defeated by Yoshitsune, and killed while attempting to flee.\"\n\nNo mention of Munemori's death. He is described as leading the Taira, and the Taira are fleeing, suggesting he was still alive.\n\nTherefore, **Munemori lived longer than Kiyomori** \u2014 Kiyomori died earlier, when Munemori took over.\n\nThus, **Munemori died later**.", "reasoning": "S0[Kiyomori: died before 1183, Munemori: succeeded 1183] \u2192 S1[Munemori active in 1183\u20131184, not dead]\u2713 \u2192 S2[Kiyomori died earlier, Munemori later] \u27f9 S3[\u2713Munemori died later]"}

In 1476 the Crossen district became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, when the widow of the Piast ruler, Barbara von Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles, inherited Crossen. In 1526 Silesia was acquired by Austria's Habsburg Monarchy after the death of King Louis II of Bohemia. Brandenburg contested the inheritance, citing a treaty made with Frederick II of Legnica, but Silesia largely remained under Habsburg control until 1742.

{"question": "In January 2002, the United States Special Operations Command, Pacific deployed to the Philippines to advise and assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combating Filipino Islamist groups. The operations were mainly focused on removing the Abu Sayyaf group and Jemaah Islamiyah  from their stronghold on the island of Basilan. The second portion of the operation was conducted as a humanitarian program called \"Operation Smiles\". The goal of the program was to provide medical care and services to the region of Basilan as part of a \"Hearts and Minds\" program. Joint Special Operations Task Force - Philippines disbanded in June 2014, ending a successful 12-year mission. After JSOTF-P had disbanded, as late as November 2014, American forces continued to operate in the Philippines under the name \"PACOM Augmentation Team\", until February 24, 2015. By 2018, American operations within the Philippines against terrorist was renamed Operation Pacific Eagle, which involves as many as 300 advisers. What group had their stronghold on the island of Basilan in January 2002?", "answer": "Abu Sayyaf", "original_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n\nThe question asks which group had their stronghold on the island of Basilan in January 2002, in the context of U.S. operations in the Philippines.\n\nFrom the provided text, it states: \"The operations were mainly focused on removing the Abu Sayyaf group and Jemaah Islamiyah from their stronghold on the island of Basilan.\"\n\nThis directly indicates that both Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah were operating from Basilan. However, the question specifically asks which group had their stronghold there in January 2002, and the text specifies that the U.S. operations were focused on removing both groups from their stronghold on Basilan.\n\nBut the key detail is that the operations were \"mainly focused\" on removing both, and the text explicitly names both as having strongholds on Basilan. However, the question is asking for a specific group \u2014 and the text does not say one had a stronger or exclusive presence, but rather that both were targeted.\n\nStill, the text says: \"the operations were mainly focused on removing the Abu Sayyaf group and Jemaah Islamiyah from their stronghold on the island of Basilan.\" This implies both had strongholds there.\n\nBut the question is: \"What group had their stronghold on the island of Basilan?\" \u2014 singular. So we must determine if one group is more prominently associated with Basilan.\n\nHistorical context (external knowledge, though not in the text): The Abu Sayyaf group, formed in the 1990s, originated in Basilan and has long been considered the primary group with a stronghold there. Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) is more associated with broader Southeast Asian operations and has had a presence in the Philippines, but its primary stronghold was not in Basilan \u2014 it operated more in Mindanao and other areas.\n\nHowever, the provided text explicitly states both groups were removed from their stronghold on Basilan. So both had strongholds there.\n\nBut the question says \"what group\" \u2014 singular \u2014 and the text lists both. Since the text says \"the Abu Sayyaf group and Jemaah Islamiyah\" and specifies both were removed from their stronghold on Basilan, and since the question is asking for a group (singular), we must determine if one is more directly tied to the island.\n\nGiven that the text says the operations were focused on removing both, and both are named, but the primary group historically linked to Basilan is Abu Sayyaf \u2014 and the text does not specify one over the other \u2014 the most accurate interpretation is that both had strongholds, but the question may expect the group most directly associated with Basilan.\n\nHowever, the text does not differentiate. Therefore, the most precise answer based on the provided text is that both Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah had strongholds on Basilan.\n\nBut the question asks for \"what group\" \u2014 singular \u2014 so we must pick one.\n\nIn the absence of a clear singular designation, and given that the text says \"the Abu Sayyaf group and Jemaah Islamiyah\" \u2014 implying both \u2014 and the operations were focused on removing both \u2014 the safest inference is that the group most prominently associated with Basilan is Abu Sayyaf.\n\nMoreover, in U.S. military reporting, Abu Sayyaf was the primary group operating from Basilan during that period.\n\nThus, based on the text and historical context, the group most directly tied to Basilan in January 2002 is Abu Sayyaf.", "reasoning": "S0[2002, Philippines, Basilan] \u2192 S1[Abu Sayyaf & Jemaah Islamiyah: stronghold on Basilan]\u2713 \u2192 S2[focus: remove both from Basilan] \u2192 S3[Abu Sayyaf: primary group on Basilan] \u22b3Abu Sayyaf"}

These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.

The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful.

The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27\u00a0May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck. In November 1939, the United States, who were taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies, amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort. The US started strategic planning to prepare for a full scale offensive against Germany. At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy and Germany as the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined. Romania and Hungary would make major contributions to the Axis war against the USSR; in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR.

{"question": "In 1594, the Nine Years' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.

{"question": "The Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of Port Arthur. During the night of 13-14 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several concrete-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port, but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3-4 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral Makarov had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade. On 12 April 1904, two Russian pre-dreadnought battleships, the flagship Petropavlovsk and the Pobeda, slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The Petropavlovsk sank almost immediately, while the Pobeda had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, perished on the battleship Petropavlovsk. On 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British war correspondents who were taking the ship Haimun into warzones to report for the London-based Times newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet. The Russians quickly learned, and soon employed, the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying. On 15 May 1904, two Japanese battleships, the Yashima and the Hatsuse, were lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, each striking at least two mines. The Hatsuse sank within minutes, taking 450 sailors with her, while the Yashima sank while under tow towards Korea for repairs. On 23 June 1904, a breakout attempt by the Russian squadron, now under the command of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, failed. By the end of the month, Japanese artillery were firing shells into the harbour.

When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

During the 19th century, Taunton became known as the \"Silver City\", as it was home to many silversmithing operations, including Reed & Barton, F.B. Rogers, and Poole Silver. In the 19th century, Taunton was also the center of an important iron-making industry, utilizing much bog iron from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves , tacks  and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works  also operated in the city during this time. Taunton was also home to several textile mills  and other industries, such as felt  and brick making.

{"question": "The Japanese attempted to deny the Russians use of Port Arthur. During the night of 13-14 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several concrete-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port, but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3-4 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral Makarov had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade. On 12 April 1904, two Russian pre-dreadnought battleships, the flagship Petropavlovsk and the Pobeda, slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The Petropavlovsk sank almost immediately, while the Pobeda had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, perished on the battleship Petropavlovsk. On 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British war correspondents who were taking the ship Haimun into warzones to report for the London-based Times newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet. The Russians quickly learned, and soon employed, the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying. On 15 May 1904, two Japanese battleships, the Yashima and the Hatsuse, were lured into a recently laid Russian minefield off Port Arthur, each striking at least two mines. The Hatsuse sank within minutes, taking 450 sailors with her, while the Yashima sank while under tow towards Korea for repairs. On 23 June 1904, a breakout attempt by the Russian squadron, now under the command of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, failed. By the end of the month, Japanese artillery were firing shells into the harbour.

After starting the 1981 NFL season 0\u20135, the Redskins won eight out of their next 11 games and finished the season 8\u20138. Starting on September 21, 1982, the NFL faced a 57-day long players 1982 NFL strike, which reduced the 1982 NFL season from a 16-game schedule to a nine-game schedule. Because of the shortened season, the NFL adopted a special 16-team playoff tournament, in which eight teams from each conference were seeded 1\u20138 based on their regular season records. After the strike was settled, the Redskins dominated, winning six out of the seven remaining games to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976 NFL season.

{"question": "While attending to his pastoral duties, Laestadius continued his interest in botany and authored a number of articles on plant life in Lapland.  Because of the wide recognition for his knowledge of botany and the Sami, the French Admiralty invited Laestadius to participate in the La Recherche Expedition to Samiland of 1838-40.  As an expedition member, Laestadius served as field guide for the islands and the interior of Northern Norway and Sweden, studying both plant life and the culture of the Sami inhabitants. During the expedition, Laestadius at the request of the organizers began his manuscript.  Eventually published for the first time more than 150 years later Fragments of Lappish Mythology provides a snapshot of Sami traditional religious beliefs that by the 1830s were passing into history due to the Church of Sweden's Christianization mandate in full swing at that time.  However, Laestadius did not finish the manuscript until long afterward.  Then the completed work was lost for many years.  Due to these and other reasons, the manuscript was not published until 1997, over 150 years after the expedition.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories.

{"question": "During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.

The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950 \u00b0C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200 K. As 2.574  43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430 \u00b0C or 5700 K (the modern value is 5778 K). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800 \u00b0C to as high as 13,000,000 \u00b0C were claimed. The lower value of 1800 \u00b0C was determined by Claude Pouillet (1790\u20131868) in 1838 using the Dulong\u2013Petit law. Pouillet also took just half the value of the Suns correct energy flux.

{"question": "Coming off of their Week 9 bye, the Patriots hosted the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday Night Football in a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX. The Patriots marched 75 yards in 9 plays on their first drive of the game, with LeGarrette Blount scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. Placekicker Stephen Gostkowski's kick went out of bounds, giving Seattle the ball at their own 40. The Seahawks reached the Patriots 8-yard line, but the Patriots red zone defense held them to a 26-yard field goal by placekicker Steven Hauschka and the score was 7-3. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Seahawks drove 66 yards in 10 plays, reaching the Patriots 13, but once again the Patriots kept them out of the end zone, and Hauschka kicked a 31-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 7-6. After another Patriots three-and-out, the Seahawks 65 yards in 10 plays, this time reaching the end zone on quarterback Russell Wilson's 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Doug Baldwin, but the PAT was blocked, keeping the score 12-7. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Gronkowski seemed to fumble after being hit hard by safety Earl Thomas, but replay overturned it. Two plays later, cornerback DeShawn Shead intercepted quarterback Tom Brady at the Seattle 22 and returned it 2 yards to the Seahawks 24. The Patriots forced Seattle to punt, then marched 81 yards in 11 plays, scoring on Blount's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:05 remaining in the first half. However, 1:05 was too much time for Seattle as they raced 75 yards in under a minute, with Wilson finding Baldwin wide open in the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown, giving Seattle a 19-14 lead at halftime. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots had their way with Seattle on 10 play, 91-yard drive, scoring on Blount's 13-yard touchdown run,re-taking the lead, 21-19. Seattle countered with a long drive of their own, advancing 52 yards in 9 plays, taking a 22-21 lead on Hauschka's 41-yard field goal. The Patriots countered Seattle's field goal with one of their own, marching 63 yards in 10 plays, reaching the Seattle, but the Seahawks clamped down, and drove the Patriots back to the 12 and forced them to settle for Gostkowski's 30-yard field goal, retaking the lead 24-22. Seattle countered as well, racing 58 yards in 8 plays, reaching the New England 5, but the Patriots red zone defense once more kept them out of the end zone, and Hauschka was good from 23 yards away, his fourth, retaking the lead for Seattle, 25-24. Kickoff returner Cyrus Jones fumbled the kick return, but safety Nate Ebner recovered, but two plays later, after a 5-yard gain, safety Kam Chancellor forced wide receiver Julian Edelman to fumble, with Richard Sherman returning the ball 14-yards to the Patriots 48. Eight plays later, Wilson capped off the 48-yard drive with his touchdown pass to Baldwin, with a failed two point conversion, keeping the Patriots in the game 31-24. Facing a 3rd-and-10 at their own 46, Brady hit Edelman on a 30-yard bomb to the Seahawks 24. After a 4-yard loss by Blount, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 26-yard bomb to the Seahawks 2. Very close to the end zone, Brady gained 1-yard on the sneak attempt. But on the very next play, Blount was stuffed for no gain, bringing up 3rd-and-Goal at the 1. Brady tried to sneak again, but fumbled and recovered at the Seahawks 2. On 4th-and-Goal Gronkowski couldn't catch a pass from Brady and the Patriots turned it over on downs.

{"question": "In 1594, the Nine Years' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.

The English victory at Kinsale effectively ended Spanish military involvement in the war. The Spanish, recognizing the futility of further resistance and the lack of support from their allies, accepted terms of surrender and withdrew.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.

{"question": "Week ten featured the Bears attempting to avoid suffering the first sweep by the Lions since 2007, while also trying to claim the division lead; the last time the two teams faced each other in a late-season game for the division lead was in 1991, which ended in a Chicago 20-10 win. However, the Bears had won the last five games against the Lions at Soldier Field. On November 7, Marc Trestman announced that Jay Cutler has been cleared by doctors to return against Detroit, despite having been projected to be out for approximately four weeks. Against the Lions, Cutler was 7-2, and won all four home games. On the offensive side, Jeff Joniak states that the Lions defensive line \"are ferocious up the middle, they are physical, and they make you pay for poor technique,\" but that \"there is growing confidence that the Bears offense is a resilient one;\" the Bears had the fewest pre-snap penalties in the league, and only one false start. The Bears could also seize the Lions' cornerback corps, which struggled during the season, allowing 11 plays of 40 yards or more, along with 4.7 yards per carry. Defensively, Sports Illustrated writers Chris Burke and Doug Farrar wrote the Bears must attempt to hinder Reggie Bush, and improve their performance from the previous week, when the Packers' running game ran for 190 yards and two touchdowns. The Bears also had to prevent Calvin Johnson from excelling; against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson recorded 329 receiving yards. Chicago scored first after Cutler's 32-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall capped a 65-yard drive that took just 2:23. However, the Lions would travel 85 yards to tie on Matthew Stafford's 5-yard pass to Kris Durham. In the following quarter, the Bears reached the Lions' 4-yard line, but Cutler's pass was tipped by Ndamukong Suh, and intercepted by DeAndre Levy in the endzone; both teams would fail to score in the quarter. During the quarter, Cutler began showing signs of struggling due to an ankle injury. In the third quarter, the Lions would score on Stafford's four-yard touchdown to Johnson. Afterwards, the Bears were forced to settle for a 25-yard field goal, narrowing the gap to one point. In the fourth, Stafford was intercepted by Chris Conte, who reached Detroit's 9-yard line, and Cutler would then throw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, which was eventually nullified. After an incomplete pass, Gould kicked a 32-yard field goal to draw the score to 14-13. However, Johnson would catch a 14-yard pass from Stafford to increase the lead to 21-13, and with 2:22 remaining, Josh McCown entered the game in favor of Cutler, and guided the Bears' offense 74 yards, culminating in McCown's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall with 40 seconds to go. On the two-point conversion, McCown's pass to tight end Dante Rosario fell incomplete, but Willie Young was penalized for roughing the passer, allowing the Bears a second chance, which failed after Matt Fort&#233; was tackled by Nick Fairley in the backfield. The Bears' onside kick would backfire, as Joique Bell recovered, sealing a season sweep for the Lions. Despite stating he was \"100 percent\" healthy after the groin injury suffered two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass during the third quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up.  Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, \"It held up OK. It's all on the same leg so I think that was a problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think.\" Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.

Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result.  There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923. By February 1923, under the 1922 Special Powers Act the British were detaining 263 men on the Argenta, which was moored in Belfast Lough.

{"question": "Those who landed at Skagway made their way over the White Pass before cutting across to Bennett Lake. Although the trail began gently, it progressed over several mountains with paths as narrow as 2 feet  and in wider parts covered with boulders and sharp rocks. Under these conditions horses died in huge numbers, giving the route the informal name of Dead Horse Trail. The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds  packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail.

{"question": "Following a national plebiscite in July 1937, the new Constitution of Ireland  came into force on 29 December 1937. This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and called the state Ireland, or \u00c9ire in Irish.

The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936. Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open.

Ireland remained neutral during World War II, a period it described as the Emergency. Ireland's link with the Commonwealth was terminated with the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and declared that the state was a republic. At the time, a declaration of a republic terminated Commonwealth membership. This rule was changed 10 days after Ireland declared itself a republic, with the London Declaration of 28 April 1949.

This act formally declared Ireland a republic and terminated its remaining ties with the British Commonwealth. It was through this act that Ireland officially became a republic, and as a result, ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth.\n\nSince 1937 is earlier than 1949, the new Constitution of Ireland came into effect before the Republic of Ireland Act.\n\nTherefore, the new Constitution of Ireland happened first.", "reasoning": "S0[1937: Constitution] \u2192 S1[1949: Republic Act] \u27f9 S2[1937<1949] \u22b3 Constitution first"}

Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, Naples was given to Charles VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. When Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, Ferdinand IV. Despite the two Kingdoms being in a personal union under the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasts, they remained constitutionally separate. Being a member of the House of Bourbon, Ferdinand IV was a natural opponent of the French Revolution and Napoleon. In 1798, he briefly occupied Rome, but was expelled from it by French Revolutionary forces within the year. Soon afterwards Ferdinand fled to Sicily. In January 1799 the French armies installed a Parthenopaean Republic, but this proved short-lived, and a peasant counter-revolution inspired by the clergy allowed Ferdinand to return to his capital. However, in 1801 Ferdinand was compelled to make important concessions to the French by the Treaty of Florence, which reinforced France's position as the dominant power in mainland Italy.

However, for those watching the game on TV it was difficult to tell who picked the pass off or where he was. The reason was CBS' main camera feed was covered with so many raindrops that identifying specific players on the field was nearly impossible.

{"question": "The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924.

Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods.

However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line.

However, on the first play of the Bengals' third possession, running back Jeremy Hill reeled off an 85-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The Bengals claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. On the Broncos' next possession, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Bengals' safety Reggie Nelson, and the Bengals capitalized, with Dalton connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jermaine Gresham. A 49-yard field goal by Nugent with one minute remaining in the first half increased the Bengals' lead to 20-7. The Broncos had one last possession before halftime, however, placekicker Connor Barth missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt. On the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, return specialist Omar Bolden returned the opening kickoff to the Bengals' 21-yard line. Four plays later, running back C. J.

{"question": "In 1594, the Nine Years' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.

{"question": "Ivan III considered himself an heir to the fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Rus' and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'. Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power.

Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests.

{"question": "In week seven, the Packers traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to face the 1-5 Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium. The Browns started off the contest with the ball at their own 45-yard line after Packers kicker Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds on the opening kickoff. The Browns couldn't manage to move the ball effectively on their first possession though failing to convert their first third down of the game and had to settle for a punt. After the punt the Packers took over at their own 14-yard line and ran the ball on ten of the eleven plays of their first drive, moving the ball all the way down to the Cleveland 32-yard line where backup running back Brandon Jackson came up a yard short on a third and three. The Packers offense stayed on the field and quarterback Aaron Rodgers attempted a quarterback sneak up the middle but the attempt failed to gain any yards and the ball was turned over on downs. Cleveland's second drive of the game was more successful than the previous, with the biggest gain of the drive coming on a 22-yard pass from quarterback Derek Anderson to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi who beat Packers cornerback Al Harris on a square in route. Harris also grabbed Massaquoi's face mask on the tackle and the Packers were penalized 15 yards for the infraction. The Browns managed to advance the ball down deep into the red zone, but the Packers defense held the Browns out of the end zone and forced them to settle for a 22-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter that hit the upright but deflected through to give the Browns an early 3-0 lead. On the Packers' next drive, Aaron Rodgers and company moved the ball down to the Cleveland 48-yard line with a short pass to Donald Lee, a 13-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 6-yard pass to Greg Jennings. The drive was capped off with a short right pass from Aaron Rodgers to linebacker turned tight end Spencer Havner. Havner pulled in the pass and ran down the right sideline 45 yards for a touchdown to claim a 7-3 Packers lead. The Browns then took over on offense trying to reclaim the lead from the Packers. After two incompletions and a 5-yard pass completion the Browns failed to reach the first down marker and looked to end the offensive series on a three and out. On the punt however, the Packers were penalized 5 yards for having 12 men on the field of play which gave the Browns a first down. The Browns still failed to capitalize on the Packers mistake by only gaining 4 yards on the next three plays and settled for another punt. The Packers offense took over again at their own 14. On first down, running back Ryan Grant rushed for 6 yards and 4 on second down, but tight end Donald Lee was flagged for holding on the second rushing attempt, moving the Packers back 10 yards. Lee made up for his mistake on the new play though, hauling in a 19-yard reception for a first down. On the next play, Rodgers dropped back to pass and hit Donald Driver in stride between two defenders. Driver accelerated down field past an oncoming safety and into the end zone for a 71-yard touchdown to increase the Packers lead to 14-3. The Browns offense took to the field to try to out-fox the Packers defense. On the sixth play of the drive though, quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in which he returned down to the Browns 15-yard line for a 25-yard return. Ryan Grant then rushed the ball for nine yards on second down to the Browns 3-yard line to set up first and goal at the three. After an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings, Ryan Grant rushed for 2 more yards on second down falling a yard short of the touchdown. Rodgers then passed to Donald Driver on third and one but the pass was incomplete. Fortunately, the Browns defender covering Driver was flagged for pass inference and the Packer were rewarded with a first and goal at the 1-yard line. After a Grant run for no gain and a John Kuhn rush for no gain, Ryan Grant then managed to break the goal line on third down to score a touchdown for the Packers extending the lead even more to 21-3. The Browns took over with less than a minute remaining in the half but managed to have to settle for one final hail Mary attempt into the end zone which was batted down incomplete to end the half with the Packers leading 21-3. After the half, the Packers started out with possession and managed to move the ball down to the Browns 37-yard line with multiple short yardage gains both passing and rushing. After an offensive pass interference penalty on Donald Lee, the Packers failed to convert on third and 20 and had to settle for a 55-yard field goal attempt on which kicker Mason Crosby missed wide left. The Browns then took over after the missed attempt and running back Jamal Lewis rushed for 4 yards on first and 4 on second down to set the Browns up with a 3rd and 2 on the Packers 47. On third down, Anderson dropped back to pass and threw a ball short right to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Charles Woodson immediately hit Cribbs knocking the ball out of his possession. The ball was recovered by the Packers at the Packers 48 by Packers linebacker Brandon Chillar. The Packers offense then got into another string of multiple rushing attempts in which was started out with a 15-yard carry by Grant.  Rodgers also completed a 16-yard pass to Donald Lee on the drive which stalled when a short pass to Ryan Grant on third down  and four only gained three yards down to the Browns 1-yard line. Crosby came onto the field and converted a chip shot field goal to extend the Packers lead to 24-3. The Browns managed to move the ball much more effectively than previous attempts on their corresponding drive moving the ball all the way down into the red zone. In the drive that in which extended into the fourth quarter, The Browns offense was held on four straight attempts inside the Packers four-yard line. The drive ended when the Browns choose to go for it on fourth down at the one, but the Anderson pass flew over wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi and out of the back of the end zone. The Packers then took over at their own 1-yard line and managed to move the ball 99 yards for another touchdown. The drive was highlighted by an 18-yard pass to Jennings, a 14-yard pass to Spencer Havner and a 19-yard scamper by Aaron Rodgers down to the Browns 39-yard line. Ryan Grant broke loose on the next play of the drive for 37 yards down the right sideline to the Browns 5-yard line. Rodgers then connected with James Jones in the lower left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown of the game, which extended the lead to 31-3. Both teams then continued to exchange rather meaningless possessions with the Packers offense now being run by backup quarterback Matt Flynn. The Packers final drive of the game started with 5:52 remaining on the clock and multiple rush attempts along with a Flynn pass to Jennings for 12 yards ran the clock down to 35 seconds. The Browns took over and rushed the ball once in which the game clock then expired to give the Packers their second successive victory, this time 31-3 over the Cleveland Browns. During the contest second-year tight end Jermichael Finley and fourth-string wide receiver Brett Swain both were removed for the game because of knee injuries.

{"question": "Hoping to build on their win over the Houston Texans, the Cowboys stayed at home for a Monday Night match-up with their NFC East rival, the New York Giants.  On the Giants opening drive, Eli Manning threw a 50-yard touchdown to Plaxico Burress.  Later in the first quarter after Jeff Feagles punted inside the one-yard line, LaVar Arrington sacked Drew Bledsoe in the endzone for a safety. In the second quarter, Giants kicker Jay Feely kicked a 31-yard field goal.  Dallas would score before halftime as Bledsoe ran 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak.  Bledsoe also threw a costly interception just before halftime that would have given the Cowboys a 14-12 lead at the break.  Due to Bledsoe's abysmal performance, head coach Bill Parcells replaced him with backup quarterback Tony Romo at the start of the second half.  Not much had changed for the Giants in the third quarter as Manning threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey and Brandon Jacobs got a 3-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Romo completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens, and Romo ran into the endzone for a two-point conversion.  The Giants pulled away as Feely kicked a 32-yard field goal, while rookie cornerback Kevin Dockery would return an interception 96 yards for a touchdown.

{"question": "This time, Pagan could not do anything to retake Martaban because it was facing an existential threat from the north. The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan.

All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus.

The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus.\"\n\nNow, the text mentions: \"the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome.\"\n\nThis sentence indicates that the Reichstadt Agreement was signed on July 8, and it occurred during the period of uprisings, specifically referencing the events leading up to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878.\n\nWe know that the Russo-Turkish War took place from 1877 to 1878, and the Treaty of San Stefano was signed in March 1878, followed by the Congress of Berlin in July 1878.\n\nThe Reichstadt Agreement is described as a secret agreement between Russia and Austria-Hungary, made *during the uprisings*, and specifically mentioned as being signed on July 8. Given the context \u2014 the uprisings in Bulgaria (1876), Herzegovina (1875), and the subsequent Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) \u2014 the timing of the Reichstadt Agreement must fall within the period leading up to the war.\n\nHistorical records confirm that the Reichstadt Agreement (also known as the secret agreement between Russia and Austria-Hungary) was indeed signed in **1876**, during the period of the Bulgarian April Uprising and the Herzegovina uprising.

Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno.

With this goal, Torres became the first player to score in seven different competitions in one season. In April 2013, Torres acknowledged his struggles at Chelsea, saying, \"I want to do the things I used to do. I did them at Atl\u00e9tico, I did them at Liverpool, but I am not doing them at Chelsea,\" but he vowed to \"try his heart out\" to regain his best form.

{"question": "In April 1918, the British Cabinet, in the face of the crisis caused by the German Spring Offensive, attempted with a dual policy to simultaneously link the enactment of conscription into Ireland with the implementation of Home Rule, as outlined in the report of the Irish Convention of 8 April 1918. This further alienated Irish nationalists and produced mass demonstrations during the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In the 1918 general election Irish voters showed their disapproval of British policy by giving Sinn F\u00e9in 70%  of Irish seats, 25 of these uncontested.

{"question": "The Cambodian-Spanish War    was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai  soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales entered Cambodia through the city of Manila.Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia  failed, Ruiz and Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597. Private individuals of Muslim Malays, Chams, Cambodians retaliated to Spain and Portugal's invasion by slaughtering the Spanish and Portuguese, including Diogo Veloso. Only a few Filipinos and one Spaniard survived the massacre. Because of the massacre, Spain's planned Christianization of Cambodia failed.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death.

{"question": "The peace Treaty of Limerick signed on 3 October 1691 offered favourable terms to Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William III. Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, cuimhnig\u00ed Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh . The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland. Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose. This event was popularly known in Ireland as the \"Flight of the Wild Geese\". Around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691. Initially, they formed the army in exile of James II, though operating as part of the French army. After James' death, the remnants of this force merged into the French Irish Brigade, which had been set up in 1689 from 6,000 Irish recruits sent by the Irish Jacobites in return for French military aid.

The text explicitly states: \"Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose.\" This indicates that the army left with Sarsfield, who was the leader of the Jacobite forces. The text also notes that \"around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691,\" reinforcing that Sarsfield was the leader and the one with whom they departed.\n\nAdditionally, the event is known as the \"Flight of the Wild Geese,\" a term referring to the exiled Jacobite soldiers who fled to France. The text specifies that they formed the army in exile of James II and later merged into the French Irish Brigade. However, the direct answer to \"who did the Jacobite army leave with?\" is the individual who led them\u2014Patrick Sarsfield.\n\nThus, the Jacobite army left with Patrick Sarsfield, as he was the commander and the central figure in the evacuation.", "reasoning": "S0[army left with: Sarsfield] \u2192 S1[\u229b Sarsfield led 14,000 men + 10,000 women/children] \u27f9 S2[\u2713Patrick Sarsfield]"}
{"question": "The kingdom of Assam was the last conquest of Bodawpaya. In December 1816, he sent a 16,000-strong force to Assam to install his nominee, Chandra Kanta Singh, to the Assamese throne. From their northernmost forts in Hukawng Valley in present-day northern Kachin State, the Burmese army crossed the 9,000-foot high Himalayan Patkai range, and finally entered Assam in early 1817. The army decisively defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Kathalguri, near the Assamese capital Jorhat. A pro-Burmese minister Badan Chandra was installed, with Singh as the nominal king. The army left in April 1817 but instabilities resumed soon after, and Singh had to flee Jorhat. The army had to return in February 1819, and reinstated Singh. A large portion of the army remained in Assam to hunt down the rebels in Upper Assam. The authority rested with the Burmese commanders, not the nominal king. Unhappy with the arrangement, Singh switched his allegiance to the British in April 1821, and tried to drive out the Burmese. His first attack on the Burmese garrison at Gauhati in September 1821 failed. But reinforced by British arms and personnel, Singh took Gauhati in January 1822, and marched to Jorhat. But the capital had been reinforced by a 20,000-strong army led by Bandula, who had just arrived. Bandula defeated Singh on 17 April 1822 at Mahgarh near Jorhat. Singh fell back to Gauhati but was defeated by Gen. Maha Thilawa on 3 June 1822.

{"question": "San Diego led 24-14 in the third quarter before the New Orleans Saints rallied for a 31-24 victory.

But it only names one specific hijacking (Ethiopian Airlines 961).\n\n- The other hijackings are not named, nor are any specific flight numbers or airlines provided for the remaining five.\n\n- The September 11 attacks are described as involving 767s, but they are not described as hijackings \u2014 rather, they were acts of terrorism that involved hijacking, but the text refers to them as attacks, and the key phrase is \"two 767s were involved in the September 11 attacks\" \u2014 this is not a hijacking event per se, and the text does not list them as hijackings.\n\n- The shoe bomb plot (American Airlines 767-300ER) was a foiled attempt \u2014 not a successful hijacking.\n\nTherefore, the only **specific 767 plane** mentioned as being involved in a **hijacking** (as opposed to an attack or attempted attack) is **Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961**, a 767-200ER.\n\nThe passage says there were six hijackings, but only one is named. The question is: \"Which were all 767 planes that were involved in hijackings?\"\n\nWe are to identify the planes \u2014 but the text does not name the other five hijackings. It only identifies one.\n\nThus, based on the information provided, **only one 767 plane is explicitly named in a hijacking event**: Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 (767-200ER).\n\nThe other events (September 11 attacks, shoe bomb) are not hijackings in the sense of unlawful seizure and forced diversion \u2014 they are either attacks or failed plots.\n\nTherefore, the only 767 plane explicitly described as being involved in a hijacking (with details) is the Ethiopian Airlines 767-200ER.", "reasoning": "S0[6 hijackings, 3 with fatalities] \u2192 S1[\u2713Ethiopian Airlines 961 (767-200ER) hijacked, 125 dead] \u2192 S2[2001 shoe bomb plot (AA 767-300ER) \u2717foiled] \u2192 S3[9/11: 2 767s involved, but \u22b3attacks, not hijackings] \u2192 S4[Only 961 explicitly hijacked] \u27f9 S5[Answer: Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961]"}
{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration.

The event described is commonly referred to as the Georgian-Armenian border conflict of 1918, which occurred in the aftermath of the collapse of the Russian Empire and during the formation of independent states in the Caucasus.\n\nKey points from the provided text:\n\n- The conflict was between the **Democratic Republic of Georgia** and the **First Republic of Armenia**.\n- The Ottoman Empire was involved militarily and politically, particularly through its campaign to control disputed territories and its subsequent withdrawal after the Armistice of Mudros.\n- However, the war described as the \"Georgian-Armenian War\" specifically refers to the fighting between Georgia and Armenia over border regions like Akhalkalaki and Lori.\n- The Ottoman Empire engaged in military actions and signed treaties (Treaty of Batum), but it was not fighting *alongside* or *as a direct belligerent* in the same way as Georgia and Armenia. The Ottoman involvement was primarily strategic and territorial, not part of a joint war effort with either side.\n- The fighting between Georgia and Armenia began in October and escalated in December, with a British-brokered ceasefire in December.\n- The text explicitly states that the conflict was between Georgia and Armenia, and that the Ottomans were involved in a separate military campaign, not as a direct combatant in the \"Georgian-Armenian War.\"\n\nTherefore, while the Ottoman Empire had a significant military and political presence, the war described as the \"Georgian-Armenian War\" was a bilateral conflict between two independent republics: the Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia.\n\nThus, only two countries were directly engaged in the fighting described as the Georgian-Armenian War.", "reasoning": "S0[Georgia, Armenia] \u2192 S1[conflict: bilateral]\u2713 \u2192 S2[Ottoman involvement: external]\u2717 \u2192 S3[combatants: 2]\u2713"}

{"question": "The city of Taunton has a wide array of architecture ranging from the colonial period to modern times. There are numerous pre-Revolutionary War private homes within the city, the oldest of which is the Joseph Willis House on Worcester Street, dating to about 1688. The city has over one hundred buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Perhaps the most impressive structure in the city is the towering Bristol County Superior Courthouse, built in 1894 and designed by Frank Irving Cooper. With its tall copper dome, the Superior Courthouse is visible from many surrounding areas. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Currently, the Courthouse Complex is undergoing a major expansion and renovation program. Other significant buildings in the city include some fine stone churches, including the First Parish Church , the Pilgrim Congregational Church  and St. Mary's Church  on Broadway. Downtown Taunton has a number of historic commercial blocks along Main Street, Taunton Green and Broadway, built during the period from about 1840 to 1920. Many large homes built by the wealthy industrialists and merchants of the late 19th and early 20th century line Route 44 both east  and west  of the city center, while a majority of the city is occupied by more modest wood-framed single and multi-family homes, many over 100 years old.

{"question": "During the Mexican War of Independence from Spain  the Yaqui did not participate on either side. It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes.  The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader.  Banderas managed to get the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexican government.  Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo.  This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns.  After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as captain-general of the Yaqui town, and was given a salary. In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands.  In 1832 Banderas renewed the war against the Mexican authorities, in cooperation with Dolores Guti\u00e9rrez, a chief of the Opata people.

The first fighting was at Rahum. This is described as the beginning of the conflict, and Banderas is named as the leader. This is the first war.\n\n- After a defeat near Hermosillo in 1827, Banderas negotiated a peace. He was granted pardon and appointed captain-general of the Yaqui towns, with a salary. This does not indicate a new war, but a cessation of hostilities.\n\n- In 1828, the office of captain-general was abolished, and the government reasserted tax rights and proposed land allotment. This is a political move, not a new war.\n\n- In 1832, Banderas \"renewed the war\" against the Mexican authorities, in cooperation with Dolores Guti\u00e9rrez. This is explicitly stated as a renewal of war.\n\n- In 1833, Banderas and Guti\u00e9rrez were executed after their forces were defeated in a battle near Buenavista.\n\nSo, we have two distinct periods of warfare:\n\n1. The initial war (starting around 1825\u20131827), led by Banderas, which ended in a defeat and a negotiated peace.\n\n2. A renewed war in 1832, which resulted in defeat and execution in 1833.\n\nThe text says Banderas \"renewed the war\" in 1832, indicating a second war.\n\nTherefore, Banderas waged war against the Mexican authorities twice:\n\n- First, in the period 1825\u20131827 (after the 1825 tax law).\n- Second, in 1832 (renewed war).\n\nNote: The text does not say he launched a war in 1825, but that the Yaqui decided to go to war after the tax law, and Banderas was their leader. So the first war is implied to have started then.

{"question": "In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion.

{"question": "Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

No \u2014 2 months would be about 60 days.\n\nSo, 59 days is **just under 2 months**.\n\nBut the question says: \"how many months after\" \u2014 likely expecting a numerical answer in months, possibly rounded.\n\nIn historical context, such questions often expect the exact difference in months, and since 59 days is less than 60, it's less than 2 months.\n\nBut let's see: is there a more precise way?\n\nWe can compute:\n\n- 30 days = 1 month (approximate)\n- 59 \u00f7 30 = 1.966.. months.\n\nSo, approximately **2 months**.\n\nBut if we are to give the number of full months, it's **1 full month and 29 days**, so **less than 2 months**.\n\nHowever, the question says: \"how many months after\" \u2014 this could be interpreted as the number of months (in whole or fractional), but typically in such historical questions, we give the number of months as a whole number if it's approximate.\n\nBut let's check the exact dates:\n\n- April 17 to June 14 = 59 days.\n\n- 1 month = 30 days \u2192 2 months = 60 days.\n\nSo, 59 days is **1 month and 29 days** \u2014 so **1 full month and 29 days**, which is **just under 2 months**.\n\nBut the question is: \"how many months after\" \u2014 so the answer should be **2 months**, since it's very close to 2 months, and the difference is only one day.\n\nIn historical or chronological contexts, such a time span is often rounded to the nearest month.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **2 months**.", "reasoning": "S0[Apr17,1455] \u2192 S1[Jun14,1455] \u2192 S2[59 days] \u2192 S3[59\u00f730\u22481.97] \u27f9 S4[\u22482 months] \u22b32"}

{"question": "In 1594, the Nine Years' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.

{"question": "In the winter of 1666, the Dutch created a strong anti-English alliance. On 26 January, Louis declared war. In February, Frederick III of Denmark did the same after having received a large sum.  Then Brandenburg threatened to attack M\u00fcnster from the east.  The promised English subsidies having remained largely hypothetical, Von Galen made peace with the Republic in April at Cleves. By the spring of 1666, the Dutch had rebuilt their fleet with much heavier ships \u2014 thirty of them possessing more cannon than any Dutch ship in early 1665 \u2014 and threatened to join with the French.:71 Charles made a new peace offer in February, employing a French nobleman in Orange service, Henri Buat, as messenger. In it, he vaguely promised to moderate his demands if the Dutch would only appoint William in some responsible function and pay \u00a3200,000 in \"indemnities\". De Witt considered it a mere feint to create dissension among the Dutch and between them and France. A new confrontation was inevitable. How many demands were there?", "answer": "2", "original_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n\nThe passage does not explicitly list or mention the number of demands made by Charles (likely Charles II of England, in the context of the English-Dutch conflict of 1666). Instead, it describes a peace offer made by Charles in February, which is described as \"vague\" and includes two specific elements:\n\n1. To moderate his demands (implying a conditional offer, not a list of specific demands).\n2. The condition that if the Dutch appoint William in some responsible function and pay \u00a3200,000 in \"indemnities\", then Charles would moderate his demands.\n\nThe text says: \"he vaguely promised to moderate his demands if the Dutch would only appoint William in some responsible function and pay \u00a3200,000 in 'indemnities'.\"\n\nThis indicates that Charles's offer was conditional upon two actions: (1) appointing William to a responsible position, and (2) paying \u00a3200,000 in indemnities.\n\nHowever, the question asks: \"How many demands were there?\"\n\nNote: The term \"demands\" could be interpreted as the number of conditions or conditions placed by Charles. But the passage does not present a list of demands from Charles \u2014 rather, it presents a *proposal* to *moderate* demands, contingent on two actions.\n\nTherefore, the \"demands\" in question are not explicitly enumerated. The text does not state that Charles made a list of demands \u2014 instead, he offered to *moderate* his demands in exchange for two conditions.\n\nThus, there is no clear count of distinct demands. The offer is described as vague and conditional, not as a list of specific, numbered demands.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"how many demands\" is ambiguous \u2014 if it means how many conditions were attached to the peace offer, then the answer would be two: (1) appoint William, (2) pay \u00a3200,000.\n\nBut the passage does not say that these were demands \u2014 it says Charles promised to *moderate* his demands, which implies that prior to this, there were demands, and this was a proposal to reduce them.\n\nSo, the number of demands is not specified \u2014 and the text does not list them.\n\nTherefore, based on the text, we cannot determine the number of demands \u2014 only that Charles offered to moderate his demands in exchange for two conditions.\n\nBut the question is asking for a number \u2014 and the only concrete conditions mentioned are two: appoint William and pay \u00a3200,000.\n\nThus, interpreting the question as asking: \"How many conditions were attached to Charles's peace offer?\" \u2014 the answer would be two.\n\nFinal interpretation: The \"demands\" may be misinterpreted. The offer is not a list of demands, but a proposal to *reduce* demands in exchange for two actions. So, the number of *conditions* is two.\n\nThus, the most reasonable inference is that Charles's peace offer involved two conditions \u2014 which could be interpreted as two points of negotiation, or two elements of the proposal.\n\nTherefore, the number of demands (interpreted as conditions) is two.", "reasoning": "S0[offer:moderate demands if appoint William & pay \u00a3200k] \u2192 S1[\u229b 2 conditions] \u27f9 S2[\u27132 demands]"}
{"question": "The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \"flex scheduling\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \"finesse team\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \"LH\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.

{"question": "Those who landed at Skagway made their way over the White Pass before cutting across to Bennett Lake. Although the trail began gently, it progressed over several mountains with paths as narrow as 2 feet  and in wider parts covered with boulders and sharp rocks. Under these conditions horses died in huge numbers, giving the route the informal name of Dead Horse Trail. The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds  packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail. Even using a heavy sled, a strong man would be covering 1,000 miles  and need around 90 days to reach Lake Bennett. How many miles did prospectors take for ferrying packages?", "answer": "2500", "original_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n\nThe passage states: \"a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles, before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail.\"\n\nThis means that the total distance traveled by a prospector\u2014accounting for thirty round trips\u2014amounts to at least 2,500 miles.\n\nEach round trip consists of going forward and returning, so it's a round-trip distance. The phrase \"a distance of at least 2,500 miles\" refers to the cumulative distance traveled over the thirty round trips, not the one-way distance.\n\nTherefore, the total miles taken by prospectors for ferrying packages is the sum of the distances of thirty round trips, which totals at least 2,500 miles.\n\nNote: The passage does not specify the distance per round trip, but it directly states that the total distance for thirty round trips is at least 2,500 miles.

{"question": "Hoping to build on their win over the Houston Texans, the Cowboys stayed at home for a Monday Night match-up with their NFC East rival, the New York Giants.  On the Giants opening drive, Eli Manning threw a 50-yard touchdown to Plaxico Burress.  Later in the first quarter after Jeff Feagles punted inside the one-yard line, LaVar Arrington sacked Drew Bledsoe in the endzone for a safety. In the second quarter, Giants kicker Jay Feely kicked a 31-yard field goal.  Dallas would score before halftime as Bledsoe ran 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak.  Bledsoe also threw a costly interception just before halftime that would have given the Cowboys a 14-12 lead at the break.  Due to Bledsoe's abysmal performance, head coach Bill Parcells replaced him with backup quarterback Tony Romo at the start of the second half.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.

{"question": "In 1594, the Nine Years' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O'Neill and Red Hugh O'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom.

The transfer of power was made September 19, 1760 in Otumba, and his formal entry into Mexico City was October 6, 1760. Among his immediate and most important concerns was the organization of a true colonial army. As he passed through Puebla he reviewed a battalion of militia formed of Negroes and Mulattoes. Their arms were very irregular, and the new viceroy made a formal request to Spain for new rifles to arm them. In 1761 there was an epidemic of smallpox that principally attacked the Indians.

{"question": "Convention uses the name \"The English Civil War\"  to refer collectively to the civil wars in England and the Scottish Civil War, which began with the raising of King Charles I's standard at Nottingham on 22 August 1642, and ended on 3 September 1651 at the Battle of Worcester. There was some continued organised Royalist resistance in Scotland, which lasted until the surrender of Dunnottar Castle to Parliament's troops in May 1652, but this resistance is not usually included as part of the English Civil War. The English Civil War can be divided into three: the First English Civil War , the Second English Civil War , and the Third English Civil War . For the most part, accounts summarise the two sides that fought the English Civil Wars as the Royalist Cavaliers of Charles I of England versus the Parliamentarian Roundheads. However, as with many civil wars, loyalties shifted for various reasons, and both sides changed significantly during the conflicts. During this time, the Irish Confederate Wars  continued in Ireland, starting with the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and ending with the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Its incidents had little or no direct connection with those of the Civil War, but the wars were mixed with, and formed part of, a linked series of conflicts and civil wars between 1639 and 1652 in the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which at that time shared a monarch, but were distinct states in political organisation.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth.

{"question": "The first decades were marked by Jacobite risings which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at Battle of Culloden in 1746. In 1763, Great Britain in the Seven Years War led to the growth of the First British Empire. With the defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa.  As a result, culture of the United Kingdom, and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide.  Politically, the central event was the French Revolution And its Napoleonic aftermath, 1793\u20131815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury.  Culturally the Victorian era (Queen Victoria reigned 1837\u20131901) was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century, 1815\u20131914.

{"question": "Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw for a career second-best 466 yards, as he completed 38 of 59 pass attempts with three touchdown throws, as the Patriots were able to hold off a late Buffalo Bills rally thanks to their high-octane offense, giving the Patriots their first divisional win of the season. The match-up between the Bills and Patriots was highly anticipated in the week before the meeting. Both teams had won their first games of the new season and high expectations for the season ahead were falling on both teams, including the host team, who were led by new head coach and old Patriots' foe Rex Ryan (formerly of the New York Jets). The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins.

{"question": "M\u00e1laga, the chief seaport of Granada, was the main objective of the Castilian forces in 1487. Emir al-Zagal was slow to march to attempt to relieve the siege and was unable to harass the Christian armies safely because of the ongoing civil war; even after he left the city to come to the aid of M\u00e1laga, he was forced to leave troops in the Alhambra to defend against Boabdil and his followers. The first main city to be attacked, V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga, capitulated on 27 April 1487, with local supporters of Boabdil directly aiding the Christian besiegers.  M\u00e1laga held out during an extended siege that lasted from 7 May 1487 until 18 August 1487; its commander preferred death to surrender, and the African garrison and Christian renegades  fought tenaciously, fearing the consequences of defeat.  Near the end, the notables of M\u00e1laga finally offered a surrender, but Ferdindad refused, as generous terms had already been offered twice.  When the city finally fell, Ferdinand punished almost all the inhabitants for their stubborn resistance with slavery, while renegades were burned alive or pierced by reeds. The Jews of Malaga, however, were spared, as Castilian Jews ransomed them from slavery. Historian William Prescott considered the fall of M\u00e1laga the most important part of the war; as the chief port of Granada, Granada could not reasonably continue on as an independent state without it.

As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins.

How many passes did Brady miss?", "answer": "21", "original_reasoning": "To determine how many passes Tom Brady missed, we need to analyze the narrative for any explicit mention of incomplete passes or throws that did not result in a completion.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the key plays involving Brady and identify any instances where a pass was *incomplete* or *missed*:\n\n1. \"Brady fired an incomplete pass\" \u2014 This is a direct statement. It occurs after a 4th-and-1 situation where Brady threw an incomplete pass. This is one missed pass.\n\n2. In the description: \"On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes\" \u2014 This is not a missed pass; it's a sack, meaning the ball was lost, but it's not a pass that was thrown and missed. It's a turnover due to a sack, not a thrown incomplete pass.\n\n3. Other instances: The text mentions completions (e.g., 16-yard, 36-yard, 6-yard, 22-yard, 6-yard, 46-yard field goal \u2014 not a pass), and touchdowns. There is no mention of any other incomplete passes beyond the one explicitly stated.\n\nWe are told:  \n- Brady completed 38 of 59 pass attempts.  \nSo, total pass attempts = 59  \nCompleted = 38  \nTherefore, missed = 59 - 38 = 21\n\nWait \u2014 this contradicts the earlier statement: \"Brady fired an incomplete pass\" \u2014 only one such instance is mentioned. But the total number of pass attempts is given as 59, and 38 completed, so 21 missed.\n\nBut the question is: **\"How many passes did Brady miss?\"**\n\nWe must determine if the 21 is correct based on the text.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:  \n- The text says: \"completed 38 of 59 pass attempts\" \u2014 this is a direct statement.  \nSo, missed passes = 59 - 38 = 21.\n\nNow, is there any indication that some of these \"missed\" passes were not counted (e.g., sacks, turnovers, or out of bounds)?  \n- The text says Brady was *strip-sacked* \u2014 that\u2019s a turnover, not a missed pass.  \n- The text says he \"fired an incomplete pass\" \u2014 one instance.  \n- But the 59 attempts include all pass attempts, and 38 completed, so 21 were not completed \u2014 i.e., missed.\n\nEven though only one instance of an incomplete pass is *named*, the total number of missed passes (incomplete passes) is still 21, as per the 38/59 completion rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **21**, based on the stated 38 completions out of 59 attempts.\n\nNo other pass attempts are described as missed \u2014 the one named is just one example, but the total number of missed passes is derived from the completion rate.", "reasoning": "S0[59 attempts, 38 completed] \u2192 S1[59\u229638=21]\u2713"}

{"question": "After the fall of Pegu, remnants of Mon resistance fell back to the upper Tenasserim peninsula , and remained active there with Siamese support. However, the resistance was disorganized, and did not control any major towns. It remained active only because Konbaung's control of the upper Tenasserim peninsula in 1757-1759 was still largely nominal. Its effective control still did not extend beyond Martaban as the majority of the Konbaung armies were back north in Manipur and in the northern Shan states. However, no single southern leader emerged to rally the Mon populace as Alaungpaya did with the Burmans in 1752. A rebellion broke out in 1758 throughout Lower Burma but was put down by local Konbaung garrisons. The window of opportunity came to a close in the second half of 1759 when the Konbaung armies, having conquered Manipur and the northern Shan states, were back down south, preparing for their invasion of the Tenasserim coast and Siam.

In the second quarter, Chicago's Brian Griese completed a 39-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with a 67-yard touchdown run from Adrian Peterson. In the third quarter, the Vikings took the lead with 73-yard touchdown run from Peterson for the only score of the period. Kickers Ryan Longwell and Robbie Gould traded field goals of 48 and 32 yards to start the fourth quarter, before Peterson scored his third touchdown of the game on a 35-yard run. Chicago tied the game again with Griese completing a 33-yard touchdown pass to Muhsin Muhammad, followed by an 81-yard touchdown pass to Hester. But on the ensuing kickoff, Peterson sprinted all the way down to the Chicago 38-yard line, setting Longwell up for a 55-yard, game-winning field goal. With the win, the Vikings improved to 2-3, largely in part to Peterson's 224 rushing yards, which put him fifth for the most rookie rushing yards in one game. Up to this point, he had a total of 607 rushing yards, which placed him second for the most rookie rushing yards through the first five games, only behind Eric Dickerson.

{"question": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.

{"question": "Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916, combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts using frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread French Army Mutinies, after the failure of the costly Nivelle Offensive of April-May 1917. The concurrent British Battle of Arras was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value. A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada. The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack  at Passchendaele . This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000-400,000 per side. The years of trench warfare on the Western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging. However, throughout this period, British, French, and German tactics constantly evolved to meet new battlefield challenges.

{"question": "The split effectively ended the realistic electoral chances of the Irish Unionist Alliance in southern Ireland. As the partition of Ireland became more likely, Southern Unionists formed numerous political movements in an attempt to find a solution to the \"Irish Question\". Among these were Irish Dominion League and the Irish Centre Party. As such, the southern rump of the IUA became increasingly fractured and in 1922 it lost its reason to exist with the establishment of the Irish Free State. Leading unionist figures, such as the Earl of Midleton,  Lord Dunraven, James Campbell and Horace Plunkett were appointed in December 1922 by WT Cosgrave to the Free State's first Senate. Amongst others, Horace Plunkett's home in County Dublin was then burnt down during the Irish Civil War  because of his involvement in the Irish Senate. The IUA helped form the Southern Irish Loyalist Relief Association to assist war refugees and claim compensation for damage to property. From 1921 IUA voters began to support the mainstream Cumann na nGaedheal party. In the 1923 election three formerly loyalist businessmen were elected as the Business and Professional Group.

Let's compute the total for both years:\n\n2000 total (Betawi + Sundanese) = 27.65% + 15.27% = 42.92%\n\n2010 total (Betawi + Sundanese) = 28.29% + 14.61% = 42.90%\n\nSo, the combined percentage of Betawi and Sundanese people slightly decreased from 42.92% to 42.90%.\n\nEven though Betawi increased, the decline in Sundanese was slightly greater, and the total for both groups decreased very slightly.\n\nBut the question is: \"Were there more Betawi and Sundanese people in 2000 or in 2010?\"\n\nWe interpret this as: which year had a higher total number of Betawi and Sundanese people?\n\nSince the percentages are of the total population, and the total population of Jakarta increased over time (implied), we must consider whether the actual number of people (not just percentages) increased.\n\nHowever, the data provided gives only percentages, and no total population numbers. So, we can only compare the relative sizes of the groups.\n\nBut since the total percentage of Betawi and Sundanese people decreased slightly from 42.92% to 40.90% (wait \u2014 28.29 + 14.61 = 42.90), which is a very small decrease, and the population of Jakarta likely grew, we can infer that the actual number of Betawi and Sundanese people may have changed, but without total population, we can only compare the proportions.\n\nBut the question is asking whether there were more Betawi and Sundanese people in 2000 or 2010 \u2014 meaning, which year had a higher total number of these two ethnic groups.\n\nSince the total percentage of Betawi and Sundanese people was 42.92% in 2000 and 42.90% in 2010, the total proportion is slightly lower in 2010.\n\nTherefore, even if the population of Jakarta increased, the share of Betawi and Sundanese people declined slightly.\n\nSo, the total number of Betawi and Sundanese people (in absolute numbers) would be higher in 2000, because the combined percentage was higher, and assuming the total population grew, the actual numbers would still be higher in 2000.\n\nThus, there were more Betawi and Sundanese people in 2000 than in 2010.", "reasoning": "S0[2000: Betawi=27.65%, Sundanese=15.27% \u2192 sum=42.92%] \u2192 S1[2010: Betawi=28.29%, Sundanese=14.61% \u2192 sum=42.90%] \u2192 S2[42.92% > 42.90%] \u27f9 S3[\u27132000 > 2010]"}

{"question": "The main legacy of the Revolt of the Barretinas was an enduring anti-French sentiment in the Catalan leadership and intelligentsia.  This would become relevant a decade later in 1700, when King Charles II died without a son.  Charles' death triggered the War of the Spanish Succession.  The two claimants were the French Philip, Duke of Anjou and the Austrian Emperor Leopold I.  The Spanish government chose Philip; French King Louis XIV, Philip's grandfather, naturally supported his grandson as well.  The Catalan upper classes, still distrustful of France from its efforts to stir the peasantry against them in 1689, had no love for Philip.  He was \"a king chosen by Castilians.\"  In 1702, the cortes voted to recognize Leopold as king, and full-scale rebellion against Philip began in 1705 with the arrival of supporting Austrian troops.  The war would continue for nine more years, until the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the last remaining Catalan supporters of Leopold were defeated by the combined Franco-Castilian army.  The Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip from 1707-1714, ended the nominal split between Castile and Aragon and eliminated the traditional autonomy Aragon had kept.

{"question": "On Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete. With 1:09 left in the game, Cutler kneeled three times to end the game. With Cutler's touchdown to Bennett, he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138.

{"question": "Ivan III considered himself an heir to the fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Rus' and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'. Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The Mongol Yoke ended in 1480 with the defeat of Akhmat Khan of the Golden Horde in the Great stand on the Ugra river. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests. Around 1486-87, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian-Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Muscovy, allied with Me\u00f1li I Giray, khan of the Crimean Khanate. Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk; raided Mosalsk; and attacked territory of the Dukes of Vyazma. Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds.

While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death.

{"question": "In 1656, the first successful iron works in Plymouth Colony was established on the Two Mile River, in what is now part of Raynham. The Taunton Iron Works operated for over 200 years until 1876. It was the first of many iron industries in Taunton. During the 19th century, Taunton became known as the \"Silver City\", as it was home to many silversmithing operations, including Reed & Barton, F.B. Rogers, and Poole Silver. In the 19th century, Taunton was also the center of an important iron-making industry, utilizing much bog iron from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves , tacks  and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works  also operated in the city during this time. Taunton was also home to several textile mills  and other industries, such as felt  and brick making. During the 19th century, Taunton was a major shipping point for grain from the inland rural farm areas of Massachusetts to the rest of the nation via Weir Village and the Taunton River. With the advent of the railroad, Taunton would also become an important transportation hub due to its central location. The city formed the Taunton Municipal Light Plant  in 1897, when it decided to purchase the floundering Taunton Electric Lighting Company, making it a publicly owned electric utility. Today, TMLP provides electric service to 34,000 customers in Taunton, Berkley, Raynham, and sections of Dighton, Lakeville and Bridgewater.

Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear. After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River.

The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

Early in the fourth quarter, Griese threw his second straight interception (and third overall), which was returned 62 yards by Charles Woodson for a touchdown. The Packers took a 21-20 lead with just under 14 minutes to go, while rookie back-up quarterback Matt Flynn took over for the next drive. With just over 8 minutes remaining, Griese led the Buccaneers on a 10-play, 58-yard drive, capped off by Matt Bryant's third field goal, and a 23-21 lead. Green Bay started with 2:26 remaining.

{"question": "A questionable role in the rebellion was played by Leonard Dacre, an early sympathiser of Mary. At the outbreak of the rebellion, he travelled to Elizabeth's court at Windsor to claim the heritage of his young nephew, the 5th Baron Dacre. After the latter's untimely death in 1569, this had descended to his sisters, all married to sons of the Duke of Norfolk. Dacre returned to Northern England, ostensibly a faithful partisan of Elizabeth, but his intentions remain unclear. After the retreat of the rebels, he seized Greystoke Castle and fortified his own Naworth Castle, where he gathered 3,000 Cumbrian troops and tried to keep up the appearance of good relations with the Queen. He held out against a siege of the royal army under Baron Hunsdon but then attacked the retreating army at Gelt River.

{"question": "A 27-13 victory over the Carolina Panthers boosted New York to 7-6 and an inside track to an NFC Wildcard spot.  In a refreshing change of pace, the Giants did not make any major mistakes and the defense forced three second half turnovers to hold off a potential Panther rally.  With RB Tiki Barber running well early, the Giants jumped out to a 10-0 lead, courtesy of a Jay Feely 32-yard field goal and a 28-yard touchdown from QB Eli Manning to WR Plaxico Burress.  The Giants surrendered the lead however as Panthers' backup quarterback Chris Weinke hit WR Drew Carter on a 36 yard strike and John Kasay kicked a field goal.  Right before halftime, Manning and the Giants went to the two-minute drill, driving right down the field.  The drive included an important third down completion from Manning to TE Jeremy Shockey.  Shockey then caught a two-yard rollout from Manning for a 17-10 halftime lead. The Giants took control in the third quarter as Weinke was intercepted for the first of three times, two by safety Gibril Wilson.  Feely added his second field goal making it 20-10.  After Wilson's second forced interception, the Giants extended the lead with some excellent running from Barber and RB Brandon Jacobs.  A slip-screen to Barber from Manning, pushed the ball inside the five and Manning then hit WR David Tyree on a three-yard touchdown to put Big Blue up 17.  Although Weinke threw for over 400 yards, the defense made the key plays in critical moments.  Rookie DB Kevin Dockery recorded his second interception of the season late in the game.  Tiki Barber rushed for 112 yards on 20 carries, Burress led the Giants with 77 yards receiving on four catches, and Manning despite a shaky start, finished 17 of 33 for 172 yards while throwing three touchdowns and no interceptions in the Giants win.  The win also saw the potential emergence of rookie wide receiver Sinorice Moss who showed good speed on catching quick-outs from Manning.  Moss had two receptions on the day.

The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining.

{"question": "Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia.

{"question": "By September 1545, the war was a virtual stalemate; both sides, running low on funds and troops, unsuccessfully sought help from the German Protestants. Henry, Francis, and Charles attempted extensive diplomatic maneuvering to break the deadlock; but none of the three trusted the others, and this had little practical effect. In January 1546, Henry sent the Earl of Hertford to Calais, apparently preparing for an offensive; but one failed to materialize. Francis could not afford to resume a large-scale war, and Henry was concerned only for the disposition of Boulogne. Negotiations between the two resumed on 6 May. On 7 June 1546, the Treaty of Ardres\u2014also known as the Treaty of Camp\u2014was signed by Claude d'Annebault, Pierre Ramon, and Guillaume Bochetel on behalf of Francis, and Viscount Lisle, Baron Paget and Nicholas Wotton on behalf of Henry. By its terms, Henry would retain Boulogne until 1554, then return it in exchange for two million \u00e9cus; in the meantime, neither side would construct fortifications in the region, and Francis would resume payment of Henry's pensions. Upon hearing the price demanded for Boulogne, the Imperial ambassador told Henry that the city would remain in English hands permanently.

Four plays later, Rodgers was intercepted again, this time by Barrett Ruud. Before the end of the second quarter, Bryant kicked another field goal, and the Buccaneers led 13-7 at halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff, and drove to the Packers 17-yard line. A play later, however, Griese's pass was bobbled by Michael Clayton at the 5, and intercepted by Tramon Williams. After trading possessions, midway through the third quarter, Green Bay was at their own 40-yard line. Ryan Grant fumbled, and Jermaine Phillips recovered for a 38-yard Buccaneer touchdown. On the second play of Tampa Bay's next drive, Griese threw his second interception, which was returned to the 42-yard line. Aaron Rodgers threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings to trim the score to 20-14. Rodgers, however, appeared to injure his throwing arm on the play. Early in the fourth quarter, Griese threw his second straight interception (and third overall), which was returned 62 yards by Charles Woodson for a touchdown. The Packers took a 21-20 lead with just under 14 minutes to go, while rookie back-up quarterback Matt Flynn took over for the next drive. With just over 8 minutes remaining, Griese led the Buccaneers on a 10-play, 58-yard drive, capped off by Matt Bryant's third field goal, and a 23-21 lead. Green Bay started with 2:26 remaining. On the drive's second play, Rodgers was intercepted by Gaines Adams. Earnest Graham iced the game with a 47-yard rush, followed by a 1-yard touchdown.

{"question": "Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Patriots stayed at home for a Week 4 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback.

{"question": "Coach Coughlin's former team dominated the Giants in 2006, when he faced them for the first time. For this rematch, the Giants were without their two star receivers; Smith's pectoral injury caused him to miss his third game, while Nicks underwent treatment for compartment syndrome caused by a leg injury in Philadelphia. The Giants had signed Michael Clayton during the week to bolster their receiving situation, but he saw little action in this game. For the first three quarters, the Jaguars' defense held the Giants to three Tynes field goals; this was now the third straight game in which the Giants were held to 6 points or fewer in the first half. Rashad Jennings and David Garrard provided Jacksonville with two rushing touchdowns to take a 17-6 lead at halftime. The offense finally came to life at the end of the third quarter, when big plays by Jacobs and Boss set up a 26-yard Manningham touchdown reception followed by a two-point Bradshaw run. Later in the fourth quarter, Manning led the Giants down the field on a 6-play, 61-yard drive, culminating in a go-ahead 32-yard touchdown catch by Boss. The Jaguars threatened a comeback, and even made it into New York territory after the two-minute warning. But Justin Tuck, Antrel Rolle, Jason Pierre-Paul, and Terrell Thomas combined to sack Garrard on three consecutive plays, the last of which resulted in a fumble that was recovered by Rolle.

{"question": " The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive to the Patriots 33, but went for it on 4th-and-1 instead of kicking the field goal and Bernard Pierce was tackled for a loss. The Ravens forced a punt and Flacco engineered a 92-yard  touchdown drive to trim the lead to 30-28 with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Smith. On the Patriots ensuing possession, Brady was intercepted by Ladarius Webb, but Webb was flagged for illegal contact and the Patriots retained possession. They reached the Ravens 44, but on 2nd-and-9, Brady was sacked for a 7-yard loss moving the ball back to the Patriots 49, and his 3rd-down pass was incomplete, forcing a punt. Taking over at their own 21 with 1:55 to go, Flacco hit Jacoby Jones for a 24-yard gain. Baltimore was able to reach the Patriots 34 where Flacco threw an incompletion on 3rd-and-9, but Devin McCourty was flagged for pass interference, moving the ball to the 7-yard line. Justin Tucker kicked a field goal that appeared to miss wide right, but was controversially ruled good and the Ravens won 31-30. With this loss New England fell to 1-2. The Ravens not only avenged the AFC Championship defeat by winning their first-ever regular season meeting against their opponent, but the Patriots faced their first sub-.500 record in 145 games since starting the 2003 season 0-1 against the Buffalo Bills, and also stumbled to their first 1-2 start since 2001. This was the fourth time in the previous ten seasons the Pats had lost consecutive games.  Also, in what turned out to be the replacement officials' next-to-last game officiating, the game was marred by a series of questionable calls that eventually provoked the Ravens fans to start chanting derogatory words towards the referees; Patriots coach Bill Belichick was seen to try to grab one of the officials as they were scurrying from the field. The Patriots were one of six 2011 season playoff teams to be under .500 after their first three games;  the others were the Steelers, Broncos, Lions, Packers, and Saints (who were sitting at 0-3 by this time).

{"question": "The Russo-Swedish War of 1495-1497 was a result of an alliance between Grande Prince Ivan III of Moscow and Hans of Denmark, who was waging war against the Sture family of Sweden in the hope of regaining the Swedish throne. It is believed that Hans promised to concede some stretches of Finnish lands to the Muscovite prince, although he did not bother to honour the agreement after he had been crowned King of Sweden at the close of the war. Pursuant to the agreement, Ivan III sent Princes Daniil Shchenya and Vasily Shuisky to lay siege to the Swedish castle of Viborg. The siege lasted for three months and ended when a castellan set his supply of powder on fire, thus \"scaring the Muscovites out of their wits\", as the Swedish records say . The following year Russian generals Vasily Kosoy and Andrey Chelyadnin severely devastated Swedish Finland as far as H\u00e4meenlinna . Sten Sture the Elder, who was then at Turku , was enraged at the news of the Muscovite expedition and sent Svante Nilsson with 2,000 men to take Ivangorod, a new fortress which Ivan III had built to protect Russian Ingria against Livonian Knights. The fortress was taken without difficulty, but \u2014 as it was obviously impossible to defend it for a considerable period of time \u2014 Svante Nilsson proposed to hand it over to the Knights, an offer which they declined. Thereupon the Swedes set the fortress ablaze and sailed home. After the Swedish throne fell to Hans of Denmark, hostilities were suspended until 1508, when Sweden and Moscow ratified a peace treaty for 60 years.

{"question": "In 1919 the Afghan regular army was not a very formidable force, and was only able to muster some 50,000 men.

In addition to this, however, in a boost to the army's strength, the Afghan command could call upon the loyalty of up to 80,000 frontier tribesmen and an indeterminate number of deserters from local militia units under British command. In reality, the Afghan regular army was not ready for war. As in past years, the upper levels of the officer corps were riddled with political intrigue.

Portions of the regiment have served in conflicts ranging from the Vietnam War to Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The current structure is by squadron, but with the 1st and 7th Squadrons recently deactivated, the 4th Squadron is the only 10th Cavalry Regiment unit in active service.  It is assigned to the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division at Ft Carson, Colorado. How many wars did the 10th Calvary serve in a combat for?", "answer": "3", "original_reasoning": "Reasoning:\n\nTo determine how many wars the 10th Cavalry Regiment served in combat, we examine the key conflicts mentioned in the passage:\n\n1. Indian Wars \u2013 The 10th Cavalry served in combat during the Indian Wars in the western United States. This is explicitly stated.\n\n2. Spanish-American War \u2013 The regiment served in combat during the Spanish-American War in Cuba. This is directly mentioned.\n\n3. Philippine-American War \u2013 The regiment served in combat during the Philippine-American War. This is also explicitly stated.\n\nThe passage states: \"The 10th Cavalry was trained as a combat unit but later relegated to non-combat duty and served in that capacity in World War II until its deactivation in 1944.\" This implies that while the unit was present in World War II, it was in a non-combat (support or non-combat) role, not in active combat. Therefore, World War II does not count as a combat engagement for the 10th Cavalry.\n\nAdditionally, the passage notes that the regiment served in various conflicts such as the Vietnam War, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2014 but these are described as service in \"conflicts\" and not necessarily as combat roles for the entire regiment. However, the question specifically asks: \"How many wars did the 10th Cavalry serve in combat?\"\n\nThe term \"wars\" typically refers to major, named conflicts, not ongoing operations. The key wars mentioned are:\n\n- Indian Wars (a period, not a single named war, but often considered a distinct era)\n- Spanish-American War\n- Philippine-American War\n\nThese are the only three named wars explicitly listed as combat engagements. The Vietnam War, while a major conflict, is not referred to as a \"war\" in the same sense as the others, and the passage does not specify combat service in a war context \u2014 it just says portions served in conflicts.\n\nTherefore, the 10th Cavalry served in combat during:\n\n1. Indian Wars  \n2. Spanish-American War  \n3. Philippine-American War  \n\nThese are three distinct conflicts (wars), and only these are described as combat service.\n\nNote: The Indian Wars are not a single war but a series of conflicts. However, in historical context, they are often counted as a period of warfare, and the 10th Cavalry served in them. Since the passage refers to them as \"combat during the Indian Wars,\" and they are a recognized historical period of warfare, they count as one major period of combat service.\n\nThus, the 10th Cavalry served in combat during three wars: the Indian Wars, the Spanish-American War, and the Philippine-American War.", "reasoning": "S0[combat: Indian Wars, Spanish-American War, Philippine-American War] \u2192 S1[\u229b 3 wars]\u2713"}

{"question": "After Napoleon's defeat in 1815, Europe's borders were redrawn at the Congress of Vienna. For the first time since the declaration of independence from Spain in 1581, the Dutch were reunited with the Southern Netherlands in a constitutional monarchy, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The union lasted just 15\u00a0years. In 1830, a revolution in the southern half of the country led to the de facto independence of the new state of Belgium. The bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800, and its territorial possessions were nationalized as the Dutch East Indies.Anglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of Singapore, which had been ceded to the British East India Company in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan's predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded Malacca and their bases in India to the British, and recognized the British claim to Singapore. In return, the British handed over Bencoolen and agreed not to sign treaties with rulers in the \"islands south of the Straits of Singapore\". Thus the archipelago was divided into two spheres of influence: a British one, on the Malay Peninsula, and a Dutch one in the East Indies.

This union was established as a result of the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent reorganization of European borders.\n\nHowever, the union was unstable and faced significant political and social tensions, especially in the southern provinces (which were largely Catholic and had strong nationalist sentiments). In 1830, a major revolution erupted in the southern provinces\u2014particularly in Belgium\u2014due to demands for greater autonomy, religious freedom, and political representation. This led to widespread uprisings and the eventual secession of the southern region.\n\nBy July 1830, the revolution in the south had gained momentum, and the Dutch government, under King William I, was unable to maintain control. The Dutch government recognized the de facto independence of the southern region, which was formally recognized as the independent Kingdom of Belgium in 1831, following the establishment of a new government and international recognition.\n\nThus, the union effectively ended in 1830, when the southern provinces declared independence and the Dutch government withdrew its control, marking the end of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.", "reasoning": "S0[1815: union formed] \u2192 S1[1830: revolution in south] \u2192 S2[de facto independence] \u27f9 S3[1830: union ended] \u22b3"}

However, the text does not explicitly state that this was a new independent or autonomist party in the sense of being a later emergence; it is mentioned as a founding party. But the key point is that it is described as a party that emerged in 1946, and the text says the Iranian army exploited conflicts with the Communist Party (Toudeh), suggesting it was a political movement, but not clearly labeled as a new independent or autonomist party in the list of new ones.\n\n2.

{"question": "The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season.

{"question": "While attending to his pastoral duties, Laestadius continued his interest in botany and authored a number of articles on plant life in Lapland.  Because of the wide recognition for his knowledge of botany and the Sami, the French Admiralty invited Laestadius to participate in the La Recherche Expedition to Samiland of 1838-40.  As an expedition member, Laestadius served as field guide for the islands and the interior of Northern Norway and Sweden, studying both plant life and the culture of the Sami inhabitants. During the expedition, Laestadius at the request of the organizers began his manuscript.  Eventually published for the first time more than 150 years later Fragments of Lappish Mythology provides a snapshot of Sami traditional religious beliefs that by the 1830s were passing into history due to the Church of Sweden's Christianization mandate in full swing at that time.  However, Laestadius did not finish the manuscript until long afterward.  Then the completed work was lost for many years.  Due to these and other reasons, the manuscript was not published until 1997, over 150 years after the expedition.

Leon Washington got the Jets started immediately when he returned the opening kickoff 86&#160;yards for a touchdown. The kickoff return touchdown was his third of the season, setting a Jets record. The teams traded field goals before Clemens led the Jets downfield, where he found tight end Joe Kowalewski on a one-yard touchdown. The Redskins responded with a 40-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham.

Suisham continued to keep the Redskins in the game with a 40-yard field goal to start the third quarter, bringing the score to 17-12. The Jets drove deep into Redskins territory early in the fourth quarter when, on a pass completion to Jerricho Cotchery, Cotchery fumbled the ball, and the Redskins recovered. Mangini challenged the call believing the pass was incomplete, and therefore no fumble was possible, but the challenge was not upheld. The Redskins took advantage on the ensuing drive, and running back Clinton Portis, who had a huge game against the porous Jets run defense, scored on a one-yard touchdown to give Washington the lead. A two-point conversion from quarterback Jason Campbell to Antwaan Randle El put the Redskins up by three. The Jets eventually got the ball back late in the game, and Clemens led the offense on a 15-play drive ending with a Mike Nugent 30-yard field goal with ten seconds left to force overtime. The Jets won the coin toss to start the extra frame and received the ball first.

The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth.

In early January 1622, the Swedes captured Valmiera, together with several smaller Livonian castles.

Since the battle turned into a stalemate, on August 10, 1622, both sides signed a truce, which in 1623 was prolonged until March 1625.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace.

The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria.

The union lasted just 15\u00a0years. In 1830, a revolution in the southern half of the country led to the de facto independence of the new state of Belgium. The bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800, and its territorial possessions were nationalized as the Dutch East Indies.Anglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of Singapore, which had been ceded to the British East India Company in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan's predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824.

{"question": "Starter Dexter Jackson was inactive for the game due to injury. Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Ravens, the Bengals played their Week 2 home opener against the Tennessee Titans. At the beginning of the game the winds were marked at 20&#160;mph and picked up intensity as the game continued, with gusts to hurricane force at times due to the passage of the remnants of Hurricane Ike. After a scoreless first quarter, Cincinnati trailed as Titans RB LenDale White got a 1-yard TD run.  The Bengals would respond with RB Chris Perry getting his first career TD on a 13-yard run.  However, Tennessee would begin its domination with QB Kerry Collins completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Justin Gage.  In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as kicker Rob Bironas nailed a 34-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Titans sealed the win with LB Keith Bulluck blocking and recovering a punt within Cincy's endzone for a touchdown. During the game, the wind was such a factor that it aided the Titan's punter who, with a quick 1-step drop, kicked a punt travelling 70 yards past scrimmage before hitting the ground.

{"question": "Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia.

{"question": "The earliest human remains found on the island of Sri Lanka date to about 35,000 years ago . The proto-historical period begins roughly in the 3rd century, based on chronicles like the Mahavamsa, Dipavamsa, and the Culavamsa. The earliest documents of settlement in the Island are found in these chronicles. These chronicles cover the period since the establishment of the Kingdom of Tambapanni in the 6th century BCE. The first Sri Lankan ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pandukabhaya, is recorded for the 4th century BCE. Buddhism was introduced in the 3rd century BCE by Arhath Mahinda . The first Tamil ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Ellalan, an invader, is recorded for the 2nd century BCE. The island was divided into numerous kingdoms over the following centuries, intermittently  united under Chola rule. Sri Lanka was ruled by 181 monarchs from the Anuradhapura to Kandy periods.From the 16th century, some coastal areas of the country were also controlled  by the Portuguese, Dutch and British.Between 1597 and 1658, a substantial part  of the island was under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese lost their possessions in Ceylon due to Dutch intervention in the Eighty Years' War. Following the Kandyan Wars, the island was united under British rule in 1815.Armed uprisings against the British took place in the 1818 Uva Rebellion and the 1848 Matale Rebellion. Independence was finally granted in 1948 but the country remained a Dominion of the British Empire until 1972. In 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A constitution was introduced in 1978 which made the Executive President the head of state.

{"question": "Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Patriots stayed at home for a Week 4 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback.

Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak.  In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game.
