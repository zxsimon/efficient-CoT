{"question": "Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat. However, it has been argued that the campaign had \"a profound effect upon Tibet, changing it forever, and for the worse at that, doing much to contribute to Tibet's loss of innocence.\".

On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army.

Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime.

Afterwards, Charles withdrew to Spain rather than attacking the heavily fortified Avignon. There is also a story that French troops deliberately left over-ripe fruit on the trees in an attempt to give Charles's troops dysentery. While Charles V was busy fighting for territory in France, he lost focus on events taking place in Italy. Francis I's armies received massive reinforcements in Piedmont in terms of generals, troops, and horses on a march headed for Genoa. France had secured an alliance with the Ottoman Empire in 1536 through the diplomatic efforts of Jean de La For\u00eat, France's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. A Franco-Turkish fleet was stationed in Marseille by the end of 1536, threatening Genoa, by planning to attack simultaneously with the French troops marching on land towards the city. Unfortunately for the French and Ottomans, when they arrived in Genoa in August 1536 the defenses of the city had been recently reinforced. Instead, the troops marched onto Piedmont, capturing many towns there. In 1537 Barbarossa raided the Italian coast and laid a siege at Corfu, although this provided only limited assistance to the French.

In 1712 the first Russian campaign to capture Finland began under the  command of General Admiral Fyodor Apraksin. Apraksin gathered an army of 15,000 men at Vyborg and started the operation in late August. Swedish General Georg Henrik Lybecker chose not to face the Russians with his 7,500 men in the prepared positions close to Vyborg and instead withdrew west of Kymijoki river using scorched earth tactics. Apraksin's forces reached the river but chose not to cross it and instead withdrew back to Vyborg, likely due to problems in supply. Swedish efforts to maintain their defences were greatly hampered by the drain of manpower by the continental army and various garrisons around the Baltic Sea as well as by the plague outbreak that struck Finland and Sweden]] between 1710-1713, which devastated the land killing, amongst others, over half of the population of Helsingfors .

{"question": "In the winter of 1666, the Dutch created a strong anti-English alliance. On 26 January, Louis declared war. In February, Frederick III of Denmark did the same after having received a large sum.  Then Brandenburg threatened to attack M\u00fcnster from the east.  The promised English subsidies having remained largely hypothetical, Von Galen made peace with the Republic in April at Cleves. By the spring of 1666, the Dutch had rebuilt their fleet with much heavier ships \u2014 thirty of them possessing more cannon than any Dutch ship in early 1665 \u2014 and threatened to join with the French.:71 Charles made a new peace offer in February, employing a French nobleman in Orange service, Henri Buat, as messenger. In it, he vaguely promised to moderate his demands if the Dutch would only appoint William in some responsible function and pay \u00a3200,000 in \"indemnities\".

{"question": "The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth. The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong. Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, Titus Oates, spoke of a \"Popish Plot\" to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne. The Earl of Shaftesbury, a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession. Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, James Scott, who became the Duke of Monmouth. In 1679, with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the line of succession - in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved Parliament. Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason. After the Rye House Plot of 1683, an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and gathered supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.

{"question": "Following Jenkins' testimony and petitions from other West Indies merchants, the opposition in Parliament voted on 28 March 1738 to send \"an Address\" to the King, asking his Majesty to seek redress from Spain. More than one year later, all diplomatic means having been exhausted, on 10 July 1739 King George II authorised the Admiralty Board to seek maritime reprisals against Spain. On 20 July, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon and a fleet of warships departed Britain, bound for the West Indies, to attack Spanish ships and \"possessions\". War was not declared against Spain until Saturday, 23 October 1739 , one day after the attack on La Guaira, the principal port of the Province of Venezuela, which was controlled by the Royal Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas. After arriving at the island of Antigua in early October 1739, Vice Admiral Edward Vernon sent three ships under the command of Captain Thomas Waterhouse to intercept Spanish merchant ships that made the route between La Guaira and Porto Bello. Waterhouse spotted several small vessels in the port of La Guaira and decided to attack, implementing a rudimentary plan. The governor of the Province of Venezuela, Brigadier Don Gabriel de Zuloaga had prepared the port defences, and Spanish troops were well-commanded by Captain Don Francisco Saucedo. On 22 October, Waterhouse entered the port of La Guaira flying the Spanish flag. Expecting attack, the port gunners were not deceived by his ruse; they waited until the British squadron was within range and then simultaneously opened fire. After three hours of heavy shelling, Waterhouse ordered a withdrawal. The battered British squadron sailed to Jamaica to undertake emergency repairs.

{"question": "The peace Treaty of Limerick signed on 3 October 1691 offered favourable terms to Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William III. Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, cuimhnig\u00ed Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh . The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland. Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose. This event was popularly known in Ireland as the \"Flight of the Wild Geese\". Around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691. Initially, they formed the army in exile of James II, though operating as part of the French army. After James' death, the remnants of this force merged into the French Irish Brigade, which had been set up in 1689 from 6,000 Irish recruits sent by the Irish Jacobites in return for French military aid.

{"question": "After Alaungpaya's death, the new Burmese king Naungdawgyi was embroiled in several rebellions, including that of Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta, and could not resume the war. The war was inconclusive. For all their work, the Burmese gained little of their original objectives. Siam very much remained a thorn to the stability of Burmese peripheral regions. In the following years, Siam continued to provide support to Mon rebels in the south who raised a major rebellion in 1762 as well as those in Lan Na in the north . The only lasting territorial gain the Burmese achieved was the upper Tenasserim coast, on which they previously had only a nominal claim.  Although the Siamese troops no longer openly intruded the border, the Mon rebels continued to operate from the Siamese territory. In 1764, the Mon governor of Tavoy, who was made governor by Alaungpaya only four years earlier, revolted until it was put down in November 1764. Likewise, the instabilities in Lan Na resumed soon after the Burmese army left in February 1764, forcing the army to return again later in the year.

{"question": "The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods. This engagement set the pattern for most Marine contacts with hostile forces in the Dominican Republic.

Lacking sufficient supplies to mount an attack Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies garrisoning Dixmude and, on 27 September 1694, recapturing Huy, an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur. Elsewhere, de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October; while in Italy, the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat's push into Piedmont. However, in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful.

With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance, William III prepared the Anglo-Dutch fleet for action. Part of the fleet under Admiral Berkeley would remain in the north, first leading the disastrous amphibious assault on Brest on 18 June, before bombarding French coastal defences at Dieppe, Saint-Malo, Le Havre, and Calais. The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean, linking up with Spanish vessels off Cadiz. The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon, which, in turn, forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter, harassed en route by General Trinxer\u00eda's miquelets.

{"question": "The Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks in their second game against the Green Bay Packers in an NFC North showdown, with a division title on the line for the Packers. After a scoreless first quarter, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's 15-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. However, the Packers scored three unanswered touchdowns on Aaron Rodgers' touchdown passes to James Jones. The defending league MVP completed 23 of 36 passes for 291 yards, along with the touchdown passes. Cutler completed 12 of 21 passes for 135 yards with one touchdown, one interception and a 72.5 passer rating, and was sacked four times. After the Packers scored their first touchdown on Rodgers' touchdown pass to Jones late in the first half, Cutler's pass intended for Devin Hester was intercepted by Casey Hayward, which then became an eight-yard touchdown pass. The Packers then opened the second half when Rodgers threw another touchdown pass to Jones. Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery was later flagged for pass interference, nullifying a touchdown pass, and the Bears had to resort to Olindo Mare-substituting for Robbie Gould-kicking a 34-yard field goal. On the Bears following drive, they went three-and-out, and on the punt return, Randall Cobb threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who fumbled the ball. Anthony Walters then recovered the ball, but the Bears failed to capitalize on the turnover, failing to gain a yard, and the team had to resort to Mare's second 34-yard field goal.

{"question": "The conflict is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. There had already been a King George's War in the 1740s during the reign of King George II, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire. In Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America, which was largely concluded in six years, from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760. Canadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years' War .

{"question": "In 1712, Tordenskjold succeeded in burning 80 Swedish naval cruisers, which played a large part in the outcome of the Great Nordic War . Since Scandinavia now was at peace, the navy focused its resources on other parts of the world, partaking in the colonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. A permanent naval presence of shifting strength was maintained in the Mediterranean Sea - protecting Danish-Norwegian interests in the region - mainly commerces against piracy. The Danish Mediterranean Squadron had numerous minor engagements with The Barbary States during the 1700s and 1800s. On several occasions these hostilities escalated to substantial actions. Some of the more notable can be said to be: the Mediterranean Squadron's bombardment of Algiers in 1770 under the command of contreadmiral Frederik Christian Kaas; the then captain, and future Privy Councillor, Steen Andersen Bille's action at Tripoli in 1797; and commander Hans Georg Garde in a joint Scandinavian expedition in 1844 - which effectively ended the Barbary states' attacks on Scandinavian merchants in the region.

{"question": "Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia. The same year, Ban Matthew Ninoslav abandoned an unspecified heresy, but this did not satisfy Gregory.

After a Bengals punt on the first play of the second quarter, the Patriots had the ball but found themselves in a 3rd-and-23 situation, when Brady was intercepted by Leon Hall at the Bengals' 35-yard line. The Bengals capitalized on the turnover, with Carson Palmer ending a five-play drive on a 1-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. The Patriots responded by going on a 12-yard, 62-yard drive, finishing it with a 7-yard Moss touchdown reception, putting the Patriots ahead 17-7. The Bengals managed to reach the Patriots' 20-yard line on their next possession, but a Samuel interception at the 2-yard line kept the Bengals from scoring at the end of the first half. The Bengals reached midfield on the opening drive of the third quarter before punting. From their own 19-yard line, the Patriots moved deep in Bengals territory after a 15-yard penalty was tacked onto a 16-yard Moss catch. A few plays later, Morris ran for his second touchdown of the night; the 7-yard run opened the Patriots lead to 24-7. The Bengals, though, continued to threaten the Patriots offensively, moving to the Patriots' 22-yard line before linebacker Tedy Bruschi tipped a third-down pass to force a 40-yard Shayne Graham field goal. The Patriots next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but a Morris run on third down from the Bengals' 13-yard line was stopped for a loss, setting up a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal. Yet again, the Bengals moved into Patriots territory on their ensuing drive, but the Patriots defense prevented another touchdown and forced a 48-yard field goal, making the score 27-13. On the Patriots' next drive, a 23-yard Stallworth catch put the Patriots in Bengals territory, setting up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Moss. Down 34-13, the Bengals continued to move the ball with a 17-yard Houshmandzadeh catch on the next play, but Palmer's next pass attempt was intercepted by Randall Gay at the Patriots' 47-yard line.

The touchdown was initially ruled as an incomplete pass, but overturned by a replay challenge. Following an interception of Saints' quarterback Drew Brees by cornerback Darian Stewart, placekicker Brandon McManus added a 50-yard field goal early in the second quarter. The Broncos were attempting to add to their lead just before halftime, however Siemian was intercepted by cornerback Sterling Moore, and the Saints quickly advanced 50 yards in only 29 seconds, culminating in a 30-yard field goal by placekicker Will Lutz. Early in the third quarter, the Saints tied the game, with Brees connecting with wide receiver Willie Snead on a 3-yard touchdown pass. On the Broncos' second possession of the second half, Siemian was intercepted by safety Kenny Vaccaro, and four plays later, another touchdown pass from Brees to Snead from 5 yards out gave the Saints a 17-10 lead. On the Broncos next drive, McManus missed wide left on a 42-yard field attempt early in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Saints' next possession, Broncos' cornerback Bradley Roby forced a fumble off wide receiver Michael Thomas, which was recovered by Stewart at the Saints' 27-yard line. Seven plays later, the Broncos tied the game, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Siemian to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. After forcing the Saints to go three-and-out, the Broncos drove down the field, but had to settle on a 28-yard field goal by McManus. The Broncos' defense forced another fumble deep in Saints' territory, but had to settle on a 37-yard field goal by McManus with 2:50 remaining in the game, while forcing the Saints to burn the last two of their three team timeouts. The Saints then drove 75 yards in only six plays, culminating in Brees throwing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandin Cooks to tie the game at 23-23 with 1:30 remaining in the game. However, Lutz's extra point attempt was blocked by Justin Simmons, and Will Parks scooped up the football and ran to the end zone for a defensive two-point conversion.

{"question": "Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats.

On the ensuing drive, the Patriots responded with a 9-play, 60-yard drive that included two more Stallworth receptions and two more Ravens penalties and ended in a 1-yard Evans touchdown run. Two possessions later, with 56&#160;seconds remaining the first half, Brady threw his fifth interception of the season, this one to safety Ed Reed, who proceeded to fumble on the return.

Brady scrambled for the first down and additionally, Ravens cornerback Samari Rolle was penalized for illegal contact to give the Patriots another 5&#160;yards, moving them to the Ravens' 18-yard line with 1:38 left on the clock. A 5-yard Faulk rush and two incompletions gave the Patriots another fourth down situation.

Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal.

For the Bears defense, it faced a Browns offense that turned the ball over 36 times, including 19 interceptions from quarterback DeShone Kizer. Entering the game, Chicago had just six interceptions in 2017, meaning Cleveland marked a prime opportunity to increase the stat. The Bears were 6.5-point favorites for the game; in three seasons under John Fox, the Bears had lost all seven games in which they were favored, including defeats to the Packers and 49ers in 2017. In spite of this, considering the Bears' opposition in week sixteen, 247Sports.com's Matt Eurich wrote it would be \"satisfying for many to at least see the Bears earn a victory for the first time in three years in which it has been favored.\" After the first three series ended with punts, Jordan Howard scored on a two-yard run, but Mike Nugent's extra point was blocked.

With the drive saved, Trubisky completed a 40-yard pass to Benny Cunningham to set the offense up in the Browns' red zone, which led to Howard's 16-yard touchdown run. Upon getting the ball back, Trubisky guided the offense downfield on a 66-yard drive that culminated in his four-yard touchdown run. A series later, Rashard Higgins caught Kizer's pass and reached the Bears' three-yard line, where he was stripped by Danny Trevathan and the ball went into the end zone, where Prince Amukamara recovered. Another takeaway for the Bears occurred with 4:11 left in the game, when Kizer's pass was intercepted by Bryce Callahan. However, neither team scored for the rest of the game as the Bears triumphed 20-3. With the win, the Bears defeated all four AFC North teams in 2017, a similar feat accomplished in 2013.

Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery was later flagged for pass interference, nullifying a touchdown pass, and the Bears had to resort to Olindo Mare-substituting for Robbie Gould-kicking a 34-yard field goal. On the Bears following drive, they went three-and-out, and on the punt return, Randall Cobb threw a lateral to Jeremy Ross, who fumbled the ball. Anthony Walters then recovered the ball, but the Bears failed to capitalize on the turnover, failing to gain a yard, and the team had to resort to Mare's second 34-yard field goal. However, the Packers would hang on to defeat Chicago 21-13, clinching the NFC North. With the Bears' sixth straight loss to the Packers in the rivalry, the Bears dropped to 8-6.

After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies, and took the Novgorod city of Tesov, pillaging its merchants and ravaging the surrounding area. The Novgorodians, fearing a fate similar to that of Pskov, sent envoys to Prince Yaroslav. Yaroslav liked Alexander's younger brother Andrew as a leader, but Novgorod insisted on Alexander. Alexander returned to Novgorod and commanded its army to Koporye in 1241. In the Spring of 1242, he recaptured Pskov. After this victory, Alexander decided to continue his campaign.

{"question": "Green Bay took the opening drive 58 yards for a touchdown, and the first score of the game. The remainder of the Packers' drives in the first half were largely unsuccessful. On the first play of the second quarter, Aaron Rodgers pass was tipped and then intercepted by Derrick Brooks. The turnover set the Buccaneers up on the Packers 32-yard line. Shortly thereafter, Brian Griese connected to Alex Smith to tie the score at 7. Later in the second quarter, Green Bay faced 4th & 15 at their own 5-yard line. Derrick Frost punted from the back of the endzone, but the punt took a \"Buccaneer bounce\" and was downed at the Green Bay 41-yard line. The resulting good field position led to a Matt Bryant field goal, and a 10-7 lead. Earlier in the week, Bryant suffered tragedy off the field, with the death of his 3-month old son Tryson. Four plays later, Rodgers was intercepted again, this time by Barrett Ruud. Before the end of the second quarter, Bryant kicked another field goal, and the Buccaneers led 13-7 at halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff, and drove to the Packers 17-yard line. A play later, however, Griese's pass was bobbled by Michael Clayton at the 5, and intercepted by Tramon Williams. After trading possessions, midway through the third quarter, Green Bay was at their own 40-yard line. Ryan Grant fumbled, and Jermaine Phillips recovered for a 38-yard Buccaneer touchdown.

{"question": "The Bears opened the season at home against the Buffalo Bills, who had a record of 6-10 in 2013. Entering the game, the Bears were 54-35-5 in season openers, the most wins of any team, and they had not lost an opening game since 2009, the most in the NFC and second-most in the NFL behind the New England Patriots. The Bears were 7-4 against the Bills, with their last meeting being a 22-19 victory in Toronto in 2010, while winning 40-7 in the last game between the two at Soldier Field; the Bears had won all five meetings between the two in Chicago. When comparing the two teams in 2013 statistically, the Bears had the advantage in three offensive categories (points scored, total offense, and passing offense), while the Bills had the second-best rushing offense, compared to the Bears' 16th-ranked rushing game. On defense, the Bears were outmatched in all three categories (total defense, rushing defense, and passing defense), but are one spot higher than Buffalo in turnover ratio (+5 to +3). Scout.com's Jeremy Stoltz writes that one of the players the Bears must contain is the defensive tackle duo of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus, who had a combined 139 total tackles, 18.0 sacks and two forced fumbles during 2013. While the Bears' offensive line boasted the fourth-least sacks, none of the five starters played in the preseason. As a result, to combat the rush, the Bears need Jay Cutler to release the ball quickly. For the Bears' defense, Stoltz stated all the Bears needed to do was stop Buffalo's running backs Fred Jackson and C. J. Spiller, as the Bills had the second-best rushing attack in the league. The Bears were favored to win by seven points, the third-largest spread of the week. Matt Fort&#233;, Charles Tillman, and Robbie Gould were the captains for the game. David Fales, Kelvin Hayden, Tony Fiammetta, Khaseem Greene, Charles Leno, Jr., David Bass and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and elected to kick. After Buffalo punted, Chicago scored on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, which the Bills retaliated with E. J. Manuel's two-yard touchdown run. On the Bears' first drive of the second quarter, Brandon Marshall fumbled, with linebacker Preston Brown recovering; the Bills would score on Dan Carpenter's 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler was intercepted by former Bear Corey Graham after Bennett did not \"turn to look for the ball in time\", with the Bills again capitalizing on the takeaway, with Manuel's seven-yard touchdown pass to Spiller, and the half ended with Buffalo leading 17-7. On the Bears' first possession of the third quarter, Gould kicked a five-yard field goal, and on the Bills' first drive of the half, Chris Conte read a pass intended for Marquise Goodwin, stepping in front of the pass to intercept the ball. On Chicago's ensuing drive, the offense rallied to tie the score on Cutler's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove from their own six-yard line to reach the Buffalo 34, but Cutler's forced pass intended for Bennett was intercepted by Kyle Williams; Carpenter would kick a 33-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Gould's 37-yarder. The Bills would kneel to end regulation with a 20-20 score. After the Bears went three-and-out, the Bills started on their own 22-yard line, but drove to the Bears' 39. On the next play, Jackson found a hole in the line of scrimmage, getting past Lance Briggs. Conte reached Jackson at the 20-yard line, but was stiff-armed; Conte attempted to tackle again, but was knocked down, with Jackson being pushed out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays later, Carpenter kicked the game-winning 27-yard field goal. Four of the Bears' offensive starters suffered injuries during the game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) did not play after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, \"It was a play where it's the end of the game - I've got to get the ball out or something. If I hit him, it's a field goal no matter what, so I've got to try and get the ball out. It's a desperation play where I've got to try and punch the ball or something.\".

{"question": "After World War II, amateur radio operators in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. \"The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society\" was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to \"The VHF Teletype Society\" and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSWs test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \"The RTTY Society of Southern California\" publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.

He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament.

{"question": "The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the Teutonic Order of German crusading knights which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century. Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially converted to  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights. The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia , an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades.

Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will.

Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but Charles Godfrey sacked Russell Wilson and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7-3, Carolina. The second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a Steven Hauschka 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7-6. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of Russell Wilson passes, followed by a Robert Turbin 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line. Russell Wilson overthrew receiver Stephen Williams on first down, but on second down and 10, by using exactly the same play, Wilson connected with second-year man Jermaine Kearse for a 43-yard score, with 10 minutes left to play. They failed the two-point conversion however, so Seattle had a 12-7 lead. Carolina responded by using DeAngelo Williams on some big runs. Inside the Seattle 35 yard line, Williams took off for a 24-yard scamper, and looked like he was going to score, however at the last possible moment, Earl Thomas forced Williams to fumble inside the 10 yard line.

{"question": "The parishes of Repola and Poraj\u00e4rvi of the Olonets Governorate had voted in favor of secession from Bolshevist Russia and had been occupied by Finland later that year. In late 1919 the Russian White Army retreated towards the Finnish border to the Repola-Poraj\u00e4rvi area. The Finnish government led by Juho Vennola decided in February 1920 that Finland should intervene to help the dissidents by diplomatic means. Foreign minister Rudolf Holsti sent a message to his counterpart Georgy Chicherin stating that Finland would disarm the retreating Russian White troops if the Red Army does not occupy the parishes. Agreement was honoured by both parties, although there were minor skirmishes between Finnish troops and the Red Army. These fights led to armistice negotiations in Rajajoki, which ended unsuccessfully after two weeks. There had been uprisings in White Karelia as early as 1920. After British forces left Karelia, Karelian ethnic nationalists arranged a meeting in Ukhta  in March-April 1920 where they elected 117 representatives.

{"question": "With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia  returned to Poland.

In 1712 the first Russian campaign to capture Finland began under the  command of General Admiral Fyodor Apraksin. Apraksin gathered an army of 15,000 men at Vyborg and started the operation in late August. Swedish General Georg Henrik Lybecker chose not to face the Russians with his 7,500 men in the prepared positions close to Vyborg and instead withdrew west of Kymijoki river using scorched earth tactics. Apraksin's forces reached the river but chose not to cross it and instead withdrew back to Vyborg, likely due to problems in supply. Swedish efforts to maintain their defences were greatly hampered by the drain of manpower by the continental army and various garrisons around the Baltic Sea as well as by the plague outbreak that struck Finland and Sweden]] between 1710-1713, which devastated the land killing, amongst others, over half of the population of Helsingfors .

{"question": "After their loss to Atlanta, Washington hosted the Minnesota Vikings, looking to snap an 8-game home losing streak. The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win. With the win, Washington improved to 3-3, snapped an 8-game home losing streak, and will have an opportunity to take first place in the NFC East with a victory over the defending Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants next week.

{"question": "By September 1545, the war was a virtual stalemate; both sides, running low on funds and troops, unsuccessfully sought help from the German Protestants. Henry, Francis, and Charles attempted extensive diplomatic maneuvering to break the deadlock; but none of the three trusted the others, and this had little practical effect. In January 1546, Henry sent the Earl of Hertford to Calais, apparently preparing for an offensive; but one failed to materialize. Francis could not afford to resume a large-scale war, and Henry was concerned only for the disposition of Boulogne. Negotiations between the two resumed on 6 May. On 7 June 1546, the Treaty of Ardres\u2014also known as the Treaty of Camp\u2014was signed by Claude d'Annebault, Pierre Ramon, and Guillaume Bochetel on behalf of Francis, and Viscount Lisle, Baron Paget and Nicholas Wotton on behalf of Henry. By its terms, Henry would retain Boulogne until 1554, then return it in exchange for two million \u00e9cus; in the meantime, neither side would construct fortifications in the region, and Francis would resume payment of Henry's pensions. Upon hearing the price demanded for Boulogne, the Imperial ambassador told Henry that the city would remain in English hands permanently. During the treaty negotiations, two Protestant mediators\u2014Han Bruno of Metz and Johannes Sturm\u2014were concerned that Henry's war in Scotland was a stumbling block. The sixteenth article of the treaty made Scotland a party to the new peace, and Henry pledged not to attack the Scots again without cause.

In the following years, Siam continued to provide support to Mon rebels in the south who raised a major rebellion in 1762 as well as those in Lan Na in the north . The only lasting territorial gain the Burmese achieved was the upper Tenasserim coast, on which they previously had only a nominal claim.  Although the Siamese troops no longer openly intruded the border, the Mon rebels continued to operate from the Siamese territory. In 1764, the Mon governor of Tavoy, who was made governor by Alaungpaya only four years earlier, revolted until it was put down in November 1764.

{"question": "Kabuls population is estimated to have been about 10,000 in 1700, 65,000 by 1878, and 120,000 by 1940. More recently, the population was around 500,000 in 1979, whilst another source claims 337,715 as of 1976. This figure rose to about 1.5 million by 1988, before dramatically dropping in the 1990s. Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the Taliban regime, and partly due to Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid urbanization mean that many residents today live in informal settlements. Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid. Although the settlements are illegal, they have been tolerated by authorities. In 2017 Kabul Municipality started a project to paint the homes in these settlements in bright colors in an effort to \"cheer up\" residents.

{"question": "During the 1920s, the HMS Argenta vessel was used as a military base and prison ship for the holding of Irish Republicans by the British government as part of their internment strategy after Bloody Sunday. Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 internees, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result.  There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923. By February 1923, under the 1922 Special Powers Act the British were detaining 263 men on the Argenta, which was moored in Belfast Lough. This was supplemented with internment at other land based sites such as Larne workhouse, Belfast Prison and Derry Gaol.

{"question": "When Charles's son Philip inherited the duchy, Francis invaded Italy. Philippe de Chabot, a French general, led his army into Piedmont in March 1536, and proceeded to capture Turin the following month, but he failed to seize Milan. In response, Charles invaded Provence, a region of France, advancing to Aix-en-Provence, and took Aix in August 1536 but his movement was halted by the French Army blocking routes to Marseilles. Afterwards, Charles withdrew to Spain rather than attacking the heavily fortified Avignon. There is also a story that French troops deliberately left over-ripe fruit on the trees in an attempt to give Charles's troops dysentery. While Charles V was busy fighting for territory in France, he lost focus on events taking place in Italy. Francis I's armies received massive reinforcements in Piedmont in terms of generals, troops, and horses on a march headed for Genoa. France had secured an alliance with the Ottoman Empire in 1536 through the diplomatic efforts of Jean de La For\u00eat, France's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. A Franco-Turkish fleet was stationed in Marseille by the end of 1536, threatening Genoa, by planning to attack simultaneously with the French troops marching on land towards the city. Unfortunately for the French and Ottomans, when they arrived in Genoa in August 1536 the defenses of the city had been recently reinforced. Instead, the troops marched onto Piedmont, capturing many towns there. In 1537 Barbarossa raided the Italian coast and laid a siege at Corfu, although this provided only limited assistance to the French.

Yan Jiaqi, founder of the Federation for a Democratic China, has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be credited as founding China's first republic in 1912, and the second republic is the people of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the region. Meanwhile, the ideals of democracy are far from realised on the mainland.

On 2 May 1769, at El Rinc\u00f3n, near Riohacha, they set their village afire, burning the church and two Spaniards who had taken refuge in it. They also captured the priest. The Spanish immediately dispatched an expedition from El Rinc\u00f3n to capture the Wayuus. At the head of this force was Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Sierra, a mestizo who had also headed the party that had taken the 22 Guajiro captives. The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed. This success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at the peak there were 20,000 Wayuus under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. This enabled the rebels to take nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards took refuge in Riohacha and sent urgent messages to Maracaibo, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Cartagena, the latter responding by sending 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death. A battle between the two groups of Wayuus was fought at La Soledad.

Members received an annual salary of $1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of $8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at $3,000. In 1907, salaries were raised to $7,500 per year, the equivalent of $173,000 in 2010. In 2006, members of Congress received a yearly salary of $165,200. Congressional leaders were paid $183,500 per year. The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns $212,100 annually. The salary of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate for 2006 was $183,500, equal to that of the Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives and Party leaders of the United States Senate. Privileges include having an office and paid staff. In 2008, non-officer members of Congress earned $169,300 annually. Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American Household income in the United States of $45,113 for men and $35,102 for women. Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government. Another criticism is that members of Congress have access to free or low-cost medical care in the Washington D.C. area.  The petition, \"Remove health-care subsidies for Members of Congress and their families\", has already gathered over 1,076,000 signatures on the website Change.org.  In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires. Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute. Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress. Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving\u2013\u2013that Congress was a \"Farm team for K Street (Washington, D.C.)\"\u2013\u2013instead of on public service.

{"question": "Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat.

{"question": " Kellen Clemens was named the starting quarterback on Monday by Coach Eric Mangini, relegating Chad Pennington to the backup role indefinitely. However, Clemens would not be throwing to receiver Laveranues Coles, who ended a 104-game consecutive games played streak due to a concussion. Leon Washington got the Jets started immediately when he returned the opening kickoff 86&#160;yards for a touchdown. The kickoff return touchdown was his third of the season, setting a Jets record. The teams traded field goals before Clemens led the Jets downfield, where he found tight end Joe Kowalewski on a one-yard touchdown. The Redskins responded with a 40-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham. They then surprised the Jets with an onside kick, which they successfully recovered, leading to another Suisham field goal near the end of the first half. Suisham continued to keep the Redskins in the game with a 40-yard field goal to start the third quarter, bringing the score to 17-12. The Jets drove deep into Redskins territory early in the fourth quarter when, on a pass completion to Jerricho Cotchery, Cotchery fumbled the ball, and the Redskins recovered. Mangini challenged the call believing the pass was incomplete, and therefore no fumble was possible, but the challenge was not upheld. The Redskins took advantage on the ensuing drive, and running back Clinton Portis, who had a huge game against the porous Jets run defense, scored on a one-yard touchdown to give Washington the lead. A two-point conversion from quarterback Jason Campbell to Antwaan Randle El put the Redskins up by three. The Jets eventually got the ball back late in the game, and Clemens led the offense on a 15-play drive ending with a Mike Nugent 30-yard field goal with ten seconds left to force overtime.

In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire.

At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed.

{"question": "After Oakland began the game with a 3-and-out, Denver sustained a long drive deep into Oakland territory. However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno. It was the first touchdown of Moreno's NFL career. Oakland was forced to punt on their next drive. However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back Correll Buckhalter fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back Darren McFadden fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal. The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star defensive end Elvis Dumervil (who had 4 in the previous game against the Cleveland Browns). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6.

{"question": "In a rematch of a bitter 2005 loss for the Giants, when kicker Jay Feely missed three game-winning field goal attempts at the end of regulation and overtime in a 24-21 loss, the Seahawks made sure this game wouldn't be as close. After trading interceptions, with Corey Webster picking Matt Hasselbeck and Ken Hamlin intercepting Manning, the Seahawks jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead on a 2-yard touchdown run by Shaun Alexander. After forcing a punt, Hasselbeck tossed a 12-yard touchdown to Nate Burleson. Manning would be intercepted again by Hamlin on the ensuing drive, leading to a 4-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Darrell Jackson, and in eleven minutes, Seattle had a 21-0 lead. Manning had the ball on his own 43 with 10:43 left in the half when he threw his third pick of the game, this time to Michael Boulware. The Seahawks converted, going on a 12-play, 63-yard drive, capped off by a ten-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Will Heller. The game got worse for the Giants, as Plaxico Burress fumbled following a reception, with Leroy Hill recovering for Seattle. Hasselbeck then threw his fourth touchdown pass of the first half, this one going 21 yards to Bobby Engram. The Giants finally got on the board with a 46-yard field goal by Jay Feely as time expired. Seattle pushed the lead to 42-3 in the third quarter with a 17-play, 70-yard drive that ate up 9:58, capped by a 12-yard touchdown pass from Hasselbeck to Jackson.

The Chargers answered the Patriots on their next drive, marching 80 yards in 11 plays with Philip Rivers hitting Malcolm Floyd for a 15-yard touchdown to put the Chargers up 7-3. On the fourth play of the Patriots next drive, Brady threw a two-yard pass to LaFell, who was stripped by Jahleel Addae with Darrell Stuckey picking up the fumble and rumbling 53 yards for a touchdown and a 14-3 Chargers lead. The Patriots drove all the way to the Charges 4-yard line, but the Chargers defense made a stand and the Patriots settled for a 22-yard Gostkowski field goal, and the score was 14-6. After forcing a Chargers three-and-out, Bolden blockedMike Scifres' punt, knocking him out of the game, at the Chargers 25. Four plays later, Brady threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, cutting the deficit to 14-13.

Midway through the third quarter, Devin McCourty intercepted Rivers at the Patriots 44 and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, but a helmet-to-helmet hit by Browner on Ladarius Green nullified the score. Replays showed Browner hit his shoulder, not his head, but the ruling was upheld.

{"question": "Contemporary documents show that the British continued the physical occupation of Chumbi Valley until February 8, 1908, after having received the full payment from China. In early 1910, Qing China sent a military expedition of its own to Tibet for direct rule. However, the Qing dynasty was overthrown in the Xinhai Revolution, which began in October 1911. Although the Chinese forces departed once more in 1913, the First World War and the Russian Revolution isolated the now independent Tibet, reducing Western influence and interest.  Ineffectual regents ruled during the 14th Dalai Lama's infancy and China began to reassert its control, a process that culminated in 1950-1951 with the Chinese invasion of Tibet by a newly-formed Communist China. The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz\u00ea was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of \"Head of British Mission Lhasa\", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself. The British seem to have misread the military and diplomatic situation, for the Russians did not have the designs on India that the British imagined, and the campaign was politically redundant before it began. Russian arms in Tibet amounted to no more than thirty Russian government rifles, and the whole narrative of Russian influence, and the Czar's ambitions, was dropped. The defeats the Russians experienced in the Russo-Japanese war that began in February 1904 further altered perceptions of the balance of power in Asia, and the Russian threat. However, it has been argued that the campaign had \"a profound effect upon Tibet, changing it forever, and for the worse at that, doing much to contribute to Tibet's loss of innocence.\".

{"question": "In week seven, the Packers traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to face the 1-5 Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium. The Browns started off the contest with the ball at their own 45-yard line after Packers kicker Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds on the opening kickoff. The Browns couldn't manage to move the ball effectively on their first possession though failing to convert their first third down of the game and had to settle for a punt. After the punt the Packers took over at their own 14-yard line and ran the ball on ten of the eleven plays of their first drive, moving the ball all the way down to the Cleveland 32-yard line where backup running back Brandon Jackson came up a yard short on a third and three. The Packers offense stayed on the field and quarterback Aaron Rodgers attempted a quarterback sneak up the middle but the attempt failed to gain any yards and the ball was turned over on downs. Cleveland's second drive of the game was more successful than the previous, with the biggest gain of the drive coming on a 22-yard pass from quarterback Derek Anderson to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi who beat Packers cornerback Al Harris on a square in route. Harris also grabbed Massaquoi's face mask on the tackle and the Packers were penalized 15 yards for the infraction. The Browns managed to advance the ball down deep into the red zone, but the Packers defense held the Browns out of the end zone and forced them to settle for a 22-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter that hit the upright but deflected through to give the Browns an early 3-0 lead. On the Packers' next drive, Aaron Rodgers and company moved the ball down to the Cleveland 48-yard line with a short pass to Donald Lee, a 13-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 6-yard pass to Greg Jennings. The drive was capped off with a short right pass from Aaron Rodgers to linebacker turned tight end Spencer Havner. Havner pulled in the pass and ran down the right sideline 45 yards for a touchdown to claim a 7-3 Packers lead. The Browns then took over on offense trying to reclaim the lead from the Packers. After two incompletions and a 5-yard pass completion the Browns failed to reach the first down marker and looked to end the offensive series on a three and out. On the punt however, the Packers were penalized 5 yards for having 12 men on the field of play which gave the Browns a first down. The Browns still failed to capitalize on the Packers mistake by only gaining 4 yards on the next three plays and settled for another punt. The Packers offense took over again at their own 14. On first down, running back Ryan Grant rushed for 6 yards and 4 on second down, but tight end Donald Lee was flagged for holding on the second rushing attempt, moving the Packers back 10 yards. Lee made up for his mistake on the new play though, hauling in a 19-yard reception for a first down. On the next play, Rodgers dropped back to pass and hit Donald Driver in stride between two defenders. Driver accelerated down field past an oncoming safety and into the end zone for a 71-yard touchdown to increase the Packers lead to 14-3. The Browns offense took to the field to try to out-fox the Packers defense. On the sixth play of the drive though, quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in which he returned down to the Browns 15-yard line for a 25-yard return. Ryan Grant then rushed the ball for nine yards on second down to the Browns 3-yard line to set up first and goal at the three. After an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings, Ryan Grant rushed for 2 more yards on second down falling a yard short of the touchdown. Rodgers then passed to Donald Driver on third and one but the pass was incomplete. Fortunately, the Browns defender covering Driver was flagged for pass inference and the Packer were rewarded with a first and goal at the 1-yard line. After a Grant run for no gain and a John Kuhn rush for no gain, Ryan Grant then managed to break the goal line on third down to score a touchdown for the Packers extending the lead even more to 21-3. The Browns took over with less than a minute remaining in the half but managed to have to settle for one final hail Mary attempt into the end zone which was batted down incomplete to end the half with the Packers leading 21-3. After the half, the Packers started out with possession and managed to move the ball down to the Browns 37-yard line with multiple short yardage gains both passing and rushing. After an offensive pass interference penalty on Donald Lee, the Packers failed to convert on third and 20 and had to settle for a 55-yard field goal attempt on which kicker Mason Crosby missed wide left. The Browns then took over after the missed attempt and running back Jamal Lewis rushed for 4 yards on first and 4 on second down to set the Browns up with a 3rd and 2 on the Packers 47. On third down, Anderson dropped back to pass and threw a ball short right to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Charles Woodson immediately hit Cribbs knocking the ball out of his possession. The ball was recovered by the Packers at the Packers 48 by Packers linebacker Brandon Chillar. The Packers offense then got into another string of multiple rushing attempts in which was started out with a 15-yard carry by Grant.  Rodgers also completed a 16-yard pass to Donald Lee on the drive which stalled when a short pass to Ryan Grant on third down  and four only gained three yards down to the Browns 1-yard line. Crosby came onto the field and converted a chip shot field goal to extend the Packers lead to 24-3. The Browns managed to move the ball much more effectively than previous attempts on their corresponding drive moving the ball all the way down into the red zone. In the drive that in which extended into the fourth quarter, The Browns offense was held on four straight attempts inside the Packers four-yard line. The drive ended when the Browns choose to go for it on fourth down at the one, but the Anderson pass flew over wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi and out of the back of the end zone. The Packers then took over at their own 1-yard line and managed to move the ball 99 yards for another touchdown. The drive was highlighted by an 18-yard pass to Jennings, a 14-yard pass to Spencer Havner and a 19-yard scamper by Aaron Rodgers down to the Browns 39-yard line. Ryan Grant broke loose on the next play of the drive for 37 yards down the right sideline to the Browns 5-yard line. Rodgers then connected with James Jones in the lower left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown of the game, which extended the lead to 31-3. Both teams then continued to exchange rather meaningless possessions with the Packers offense now being run by backup quarterback Matt Flynn. The Packers final drive of the game started with 5:52 remaining on the clock and multiple rush attempts along with a Flynn pass to Jennings for 12 yards ran the clock down to 35 seconds. The Browns took over and rushed the ball once in which the game clock then expired to give the Packers their second successive victory, this time 31-3 over the Cleveland Browns. During the contest second-year tight end Jermichael Finley and fourth-string wide receiver Brett Swain both were removed for the game because of knee injuries.

{"question": "World War II (1939-1945) devastated the countrys economy, but the high levels of economic growth that followed from 1950 to 1980 have been called the Greek economic miracle. From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average, peaking at 5.8% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2006. The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis, a central focus of the wider European debt crisis, plunged the economy into a sharp downturn, with Real gross domestic product GDP growth rates of \u22120.3% in 2008, \u22124.3% in 2009, \u22125.5% in 2010, \u22129.1% in 2011, \u22127.3% in 2012 and \u22123.2% in 2013. In 2011, the countrys government debt reached \u20ac356 billion (172% of nominal GDP). After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector involvement, Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to \u20ac280 billion (137% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2012.

{"question": "On Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete. With 1:09 left in the game, Cutler kneeled three times to end the game. With Cutler's touchdown to Bennett, he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138. Additionally, his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown, the most in the league. Miller's touchdown catch was his first since the 2011 season.

{"question": "Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \"Starving Time\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56.

{"question": "Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Patriots stayed at home for a Week 4 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down. After two incomplete passes, the Patriots lined up in a field goal formation but the holder, Hanson, took a quick snap and passed to Baker, who had motioned outside of the formation. Baker was tackled around the first down marker, but was called for an illegal motion on the play. The Ravens challenged the ruling of a catch and the first down spot, as they would have declined the penalty if Baker had been short. The ruling was upheld and the Patriots took a 27-21 lead on a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Ravens mounted a drive with 3:32 left, reaching the Patriots' red zone with under a minute remaining. On third and fourth down, Flacco's passes fell incomplete to Mason and Clayton, ending the Ravens' hopes of a comeback. Brady then kneeled to hand the Ravens their first loss of the season and better the Patriots' record to 3-1.

{"question": "Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \"Starving Time\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56. Local legend says that he loved Bermuda so much that he requested that his heart be buried there. A marker in Somers' Gardens in St. George's marks the approximate location where his heart was supposed to have been buried.

{"question": "In July 1449 Esen Tayisi  of the Mongols launched a large-scale, three-pronged invasion of China with his puppet khagan Toqtaq-Buqa. He personally advanced on Datong  in August. The eunuch official Wang Zhen, who dominated the Ming court, encouraged the 22-year-old Zhengtong Emperor to lead his own armies into battle against Esen. The size of Esen's army is unknown but a best guess puts it at some 20,000 men. The Ming army of about 500,000 was hastily assembled; its command was made up of 20 experienced generals and a large entourage of high-ranking civil officials, with Wang Zhen acting as field marshal. On August 3 Esen's army crushed a badly supplied Chinese army at Yanghe, just inside the Great Wall. The same day the Emperor appointed his half-brother Zhu Qiyu as regent.

The score marked Green's eighth straight contest with a touchdown reception, which tied him with former Bengal TJ Houshmandzadeh for second all-time in Bengals history.The ensuing Giants possession was unspectacular, with the Giants going three-and-out and being forced to punt the ball right back to Cincinnati. New York Giant punter Sean Weatherford looked to have gotten a spectacular punt away, which would have forced Cincinnati to start their possession inside their own twenty yard-line. However, a penalty on Giants cornerback Justin Tryon for intentionally leaving the field of play, rendered the punt moot, and forced the Giants to re-attempt the play. On the ensuing punt, Bengals cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones returned the ball sixty-eight yards to the Giants eleven yard line. The Bengals did not hesitate to take advantage of the large swing in field positioning, as second year quarterback Andy Dalton connected with receiver Andrew Hawkins for an eleven-yard touchdown strike on third-and-ten. The three play drive took only eighteen second off of the clock, and gave the Bengals a 14-0 advantage. The Giants would see a measure of momentum swing in their favor as following their ensuing possession, which resulted in a three-and-out from New York, Cincinnati receiver Brandon Tate would fumble Sean Weatherford's punt, giving the Giants possession of the football inside Cincinnati territory for the first time on the afternoon. The Giants would somewhat take advantage of the mistake, as they would turn the fumble into a twenty-three yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes. After both teams traded punts, the Bengals would proceed to expand their lead further, putting together a fifteen play drive that took over seven minutes off of the clock and resulted in a twenty-eight yard field goal by Mike Nugent. The conversion put Cincinnati up by a score of 17-3 with time dwindling in the first half. The ensuing Giants possession would take all but eleven second of the 4:17 that remained in the opening half and would see Lawrence Tynes trotted out to convert on a thirty-one yard field goal at its finish. The points got the Giants back to within eleven points at the half, with the score 17-6 in favour of Cincinnati.The first five possessions coming out of the half, two of which ended in New York Giant turnovers, would not result in any points being scored by either team. However, following an Eli Manning interception, Cincinnati would be able to take advantage of the short field and pick up their third touchdown on the afternoon. The Bengals second three-play touchdown drive of the game was capped off by Andy Dalton hitting tight end Jermaine Gresham for a ten-yard receiving touchdown, making the score 24-6 in favour of Cincinnati.New York's next possession would result in Eli Manning firing a second straight interception. The result for Cincinnati would be the same, with Dalton culminating yet another three-play touchdown drive by hitting first-year receiver Mohamed Sanu for a ten-yard strike. The touchdown was Sanu's first receiving touchdown in the National Football League, though he had already thrown for a touchdown in Cincinnati's week 3 encounter with the Washington Redskins. The touchdown, also representing a career-high fourth on the afternoon for Andy Dalton, gave the Bengals their final points of the afternoon, and a 31-6 advantage.The rest of the game was largely uneventful, with both teams accepting the fate of the game as having already been determined. The Giants were able to put up their lone touchdown of the game following a thirteen play, ninety-eight yard possession that was capped by running back Ahmad Bradshaw punching the ball in from two yards away. The lone Giants touchdown of the afternoon would also be the last points put up, making the final score 31-13 Cincinnati. With the victory, the Bengals snapped their previous four game losing streak and improved their record to 4-5 on the season. They also improved to 6-0 all time against the Giants at home.

{"question": "After the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority. With France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace. Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in the Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.

In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort.

{"question": "Armenians have had a continuous documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene, of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia.

{"question": "The Cambodian-Spanish War    was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai  soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594. In 1593, the Spanish expedition led by Gregorio Vargas Machuca and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzales entered Cambodia through the city of Manila.Although the Spanish invasion of Cambodia  failed, Ruiz and Veloso succeeded in establishing king Barom Reachea II in May 1597. Private individuals of Muslim Malays, Chams, Cambodians retaliated to Spain and Portugal's invasion by slaughtering the Spanish and Portuguese, including Diogo Veloso.

{"question": "A 27-13 victory over the Carolina Panthers boosted New York to 7-6 and an inside track to an NFC Wildcard spot.  In a refreshing change of pace, the Giants did not make any major mistakes and the defense forced three second half turnovers to hold off a potential Panther rally.  With RB Tiki Barber running well early, the Giants jumped out to a 10-0 lead, courtesy of a Jay Feely 32-yard field goal and a 28-yard touchdown from QB Eli Manning to WR Plaxico Burress.  The Giants surrendered the lead however as Panthers' backup quarterback Chris Weinke hit WR Drew Carter on a 36 yard strike and John Kasay kicked a field goal.  Right before halftime, Manning and the Giants went to the two-minute drill, driving right down the field.  The drive included an important third down completion from Manning to TE Jeremy Shockey.  Shockey then caught a two-yard rollout from Manning for a 17-10 halftime lead. The Giants took control in the third quarter as Weinke was intercepted for the first of three times, two by safety Gibril Wilson.  Feely added his second field goal making it 20-10.  After Wilson's second forced interception, the Giants extended the lead with some excellent running from Barber and RB Brandon Jacobs.  A slip-screen to Barber from Manning, pushed the ball inside the five and Manning then hit WR David Tyree on a three-yard touchdown to put Big Blue up 17.  Although Weinke threw for over 400 yards, the defense made the key plays in critical moments.  Rookie DB Kevin Dockery recorded his second interception of the season late in the game.  Tiki Barber rushed for 112 yards on 20 carries, Burress led the Giants with 77 yards receiving on four catches, and Manning despite a shaky start, finished 17 of 33 for 172 yards while throwing three touchdowns and no interceptions in the Giants win.  The win also saw the potential emergence of rookie wide receiver Sinorice Moss who showed good speed on catching quick-outs from Manning.  Moss had two receptions on the day.  With the win, the G-Men also snapped their four-game losing skid.

{"question": "The majority of mercenaries recruited by Gustavus Adolphus were German, but Scottish soldiers were also very numerous.

These were joined by a further 8,000 men under the command of James Marquis Hamilton. The total number of Scots in Swedish service by the end of the war is estimated at some 30,000 men, no less than 15 of whom served with the rank of major-general or above. With Tilly dead, Ferdinand II returned to the aid of Wallenstein and his large army. Wallenstein marched up to the south, threatening Gustavus Adolphus's supply chain. Gustavus Adolphus knew that Wallenstein was waiting for the attack and was prepared but found no other option. Wallenstein and Gustavus Adolphus clashed in the Battle of L\u00fctzen , where the Swedes prevailed, but Gustavus Adolphus was killed. Ferdinand II's suspicion of Wallenstein resumed in 1633, when Wallenstein attempted to arbitrate the differences between the Catholic and Protestant sides. Ferdinand II may have feared that Wallenstein would switch sides, and arranged for his arrest after removing him from command.

{"question": "The conquest of Semigallian counties started in 1219 when crusaders from R\u012bga occupied Me\u017eotne, the major port on the Lielupe waterway, and founded the Bishopric of Semigallia. After several unsuccessful campaigns against the pagan Semigallian duke Viestards and his Samogitian kinsfolk, the Roman Curia decided in 1251 to abolish the Bishopric of Semigallia, and divided its territories between the Bishopric of R\u012bga and the Order of Livonia. In 1265 a stone castle was built at Jelgava, on the Lielupe, and became the main military base for crusader attacks against the Semigallians. In 1271 the capital hillfort of T\u0113rvete was conquered, but Semigallians under the Duke Nameisis rebelled in 1279, and the Lithuanians under Traidenis defeated Livonian Order forces in the Battle of Aizkraukle. Duke Nameisis' warriors unsuccessfully attacked R\u012bga in 1280, in response to which around 14,000 crusaders besieged Turaida castle in 1281. To conquer the remaining Semigallian hillforts the Order's master Villekin of Endorpe built a castle called Heiligenberg right next to the T\u0113rvete castle in 1287.

{"question": "The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods.

Domestic demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages increases. Current account deficits of around 5% of GDP are beginning to decline as demand for Czech products in the European Union increases. Inflation is under control. Recent accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to structural reform. In early 2004 the government passed increases in the Value Added Tax  and tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections. Privatization of the state-owned telecommunications firm \u010cesk\u00fd Telecom took place in 2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds should strengthen output growth.

{"question": "At the time of this game, northern New Jersey (and, indeed, a vast majority of the BosWash area) was recovering from the widespread damage and power outages caused by Hurricane Sandy. Played just days after the storm made landfall on the east coast, the blackouts and flooding even affected the visiting Steelers' travel schedule, and the team would be forced to fly into the area on the morning of the contest as opposed to the usual day beforehand. Both teams traded possessions through the first quarter before Steelers' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger three minutes into the second period. A Shaun Suisham extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead. The hometown Giants answered, tying up the game with a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return. The Steelers were able to put together a final drive of the half, and a 30-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham narrowed the Giants' lead to four points at the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play. A 51-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace would cut into the Giants' lead less than a minute into the fourth. New York would fail to accumulate any further points in the contest and, despite a botched fake field goal attempt by the Steelers, a 1-yard touchdown run by Pittsburgh back Isaac Redman gave the Steelers the lead and, eventually, the win.

{"question": "The Conquest of Wales by Edward I, sometimes referred to as the Edwardian Conquest of Wales, took place between 1277 and 1283. It resulted in the defeat and annexation of the Principality of Wales, and the other last remaining independent Welsh principalities, by Edward I, King of England. By the 13th century Wales was divided between native Welsh principalities and the territories of the Anglo-Norman Marcher lords. The leading principality was Gwynedd whose princes had gained control of the greater part of the country, making the other remaining Welsh princes their vassals, and had taken the title Prince of Wales. Although English monarchs had made several attempts to seize control of the native Welsh territories, it was not until Edward's war of conquest against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd  of 1277 to 1283 that this was achieved on a lasting basis. In two campaigns, in 1277 and 1282/1283 respectively, Edward first significantly reduced the territory of the Principality of Wales and then completely overran it, as well as the other remaining Welsh principalities. Most of the conquered territory was retained as a royal fief, and these lands subsequently became, by custom, the territorial endowment of the heir to the English throne with the title Prince of Wales. The remainder would be granted to Edward's supporters as new Marcher lordships. Although the territories would not be effectively incorporated into the Kingdom of England until the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542, Edward's conquest marked the end of Welsh independence.

{"question": "The Northern Crusades provided a rationale for the growth and expansion of the Teutonic Order of German crusading knights which had been founded in Palestine at the end of the 12th century. Due to Muslim successes in the Holy Land, the Order sought new missions in Europe. Duke Konrad I of Masovia in west-central Poland appealed to the Knights to defend his borders and subdue the pagan Baltic Prussians in 1226. After the subjugation of the Prussians, the Teutonic Knights fought against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. When the Livonian knights were crushed by Samogitians in the Battle of Saule in 1236, coinciding with a series of revolts in Estonia, the Livonian Order was inherited by the Teutonic Order, allowing the Teutonic Knights to exercise political control over large territories in the Baltic region. Mindaugas, the King of Lithuania, was baptised together with his wife after his coronation in 1253, hoping that this would help stop the Crusaders' attacks, which it did not. The Teutonic Knights failed to subdue pagan Lithuania, which officially converted to  Christianity in 1386 on the marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila to the 11-year-old Queen Jadwiga of Poland. However, even after the country was officially converted, the crusades continued up until the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, when the Lithuanians and Poles, helped by the Tatars, Moldovans and the Czechs, defeated the Teutonic knights. The Teutonic Order's attempts to conquer Orthodox Russia , an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.

{"question": "With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

{"question": "With the tribes to the north and west destroyed, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock. 1660 marked the zenith of Iroquois military power, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the decades to follow. The Susquehannock had become allied with the English in the Maryland colony in 1661. The English had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped an alliance with Susquehannock would help block the northern tribes' advance on the English colonies. In 1663 the Iroquois sent an army of 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. They repulsed the army, but the invasion prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois. By supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the English in Maryland changed the balance of power away from the Iroquois. The Susquehannock took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674 the English in Maryland changed their Indian Policy and negotiated peace with the Iroquois. They terminated their alliance with the Susquehannock. In 1675 the militias of Virginia and Maryland captured and executed the chiefs of the Susquehannock, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois made quick work of the rest of the nation. They drove the warriors from traditional territory and absorbed the survivors in 1677. During the course of this conflict, in 1670 the Iroquois also drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. The Iroquois claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684. They acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.

{"question": "Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria.

{"question": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.

The transfer of power was made September 19, 1760 in Otumba, and his formal entry into Mexico City was October 6, 1760. Among his immediate and most important concerns was the organization of a true colonial army. As he passed through Puebla he reviewed a battalion of militia formed of Negroes and Mulattoes. Their arms were very irregular, and the new viceroy made a formal request to Spain for new rifles to arm them. In 1761 there was an epidemic of smallpox that principally attacked the Indians. Estimates were 14,600 dead in Mexico City and up to 80,000 in Puebla. The government nearly emptied its coffers  to provide what palliative assistance was possible. Viceroy Montserrat took economy measures, ordered the collection of back taxes, and prohibited hoarding of foodstuffs and merchandise. On November 20, 1761, Mayas under Jacinto Canek rose in rebellion in Cisteil, Yucatan. Canek was captured, and on December 14, 1761 he was tortured and quartered in the plaza of Valladolid. Other disasters during Montserrat's term of office included a major flood in Guanajuato that paralyzed the operation of the silver mines , and another epidemic  that caused many deaths . He also had to send military assistance to Sonora, where a revolt of Pimas and Seris had broken out against their maltreatment by the Spanish colonists. The rebels had killed the garrisons of two presidios and the governor before escaping to the mountains, where they were finally subdued.

{"question": "In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore. At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. In response, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague on 7 September 1701 renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. When the Stuart exile James II died on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to recognise William as King by proclaiming James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. The vast majority in Britain now supported war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne announced the continuation of his policies ie ensuring the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion.

On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak.  In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown.

After the truce expired in June 1410, the military-religious monks were decisively defeated in the Battle of Grunwald , one of the largest battles in medieval Europe. Most of the Teutonic leadership was killed or taken prisoner. While defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege on their capital in Marienburg  and suffered only minimal territorial losses in the Peace of Thorn . Territorial disputes lasted until the Peace of Melno of 1422. However, the Knights never recovered their former power and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and economic decline in their lands. The war shifted the balance of power in Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish-Lithuanian union as the dominant power in the region.

{"question": "The Cambodian-Spanish War    was an attempt by the Spanish Empire to conquer Cambodia, establish their own king, and Christianize the population. Along with the Spanish, the Japanese, Filipinos, Thai, Portuguese, and Dominicans participated in the invasion of Cambodia. Each country possessed different motives for their invasion of Cambodia. Specifically, the Thai interference and the Spanish expedition was a result of a power struggle between rival factions in Cambodia's government. In addition, both Spanish and Portuguese took part in the invasion of Cambodia because King Philip II ruled both Spain and Portugal. In February 1593, Thai ruler Naresuen attacked Cambodia in order to fight the Burmese. Later on, in May 1593, 100,000 Thai  soldiers invaded Cambodia. As a result of the Thai's invasion, Lovek was conquered in July 1594.

{"question": "The peace Treaty of Limerick signed on 3 October 1691 offered favourable terms to Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William III. Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, cuimhnig\u00ed Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh . The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland. Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose. This event was popularly known in Ireland as the \"Flight of the Wild Geese\". Around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691. Initially, they formed the army in exile of James II, though operating as part of the French army. After James' death, the remnants of this force merged into the French Irish Brigade, which had been set up in 1689 from 6,000 Irish recruits sent by the Irish Jacobites in return for French military aid.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration.

{"question": "The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \"flex scheduling\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \"finesse team\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \"LH\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.  Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24&#160;yards out.

{"question": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.

It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes.  The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol.

{"question": "The Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689  were two military campaigns of the Tsardom of Russia against the Crimean Khanate. They were a part of the Russo-Turkish War  and Russo-Crimean Wars. These were the first Russian forces to come close to Crimea since 1569. They failed due to poor planning and the practical problem of moving such a large force across the steppe but nonetheless played a key role in halting the Ottoman expansion in Europe. The campaigns came as a surprise for the Ottoman leadership, spoiled its plans to invade Poland and Hungary and forced it to move significant forces from Europe to the east, which greatly helped the League in its struggle against the Ottomans. Having signed the Eternal Peace Treaty with Poland in 1686, Russia became a member of the anti-Turkish coalition , which was pushing the Turks south after their failure at Vienna in 1683 . Russia's role in 1687 was to send a force south to Perekop to bottle up the Crimeans inside their peninsula.

{"question": "On 23 June 1596, an Ottoman Army marched from the city of Istanbul. Commanded by Sultan Mehmed III, the army marched through Edirne, Filibe , Sofia and Ni\u0161 to arrive at Belgrade on 9 August. On 20 August, the army crossed the River Sava by bridge and entered the Austrian territory of Siren. A war council was called at Slankamen Castle, and it was decided that they would begin a siege on the Hungarian fort of Eger . The fort controlled the communication routes between Habsburg Austria and Transylvania, all of whom were in revolt against the Ottoman suzerainty. However, news soon arrived that the Austrians had besieged and succeeded in taking over the Castle of Hatvan and had killed all the Ottomans housed there, including the women and children. The Ottoman Army started a siege on the fort of Eger on 21 September 1596, and by 12 October the castle had capitulated. As a retaliation to the Hatvan castle massacre, the defenders of this castle were all executed. Not long after, Ottoman command received the report that a mixed army of Austrians and Transylvanians were advancing towards the Ottoman expeditionary force. A war council was conducted under Grand Vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. It was decided that the Ottoman Army should march out of the Erlau castle so as to meet the Austrians at a suitable battle terrain. The Sultan thought that the Ottoman army should disengage and return to Istanbul; it was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to engage the enemy forces. The most realistic troop strength figures seem to be 40,000-50,000 for the Christian and 80,000-100,000 for the Muslim army. The Christian army had 10,000 Austrians, 4,000 Germans, 3,000 reiters, 13,000 Hungarian light cavalry and 10,000 Transylvanians, for a total of 40,000 men.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed.

{"question": "The Colts traveled to The Meadowlands for a showdown with the New York Jets. This would be the second time this season that the Colts played at Giants Stadium, as they played the New York Giants in the regular season opener. Indianapolis scored first on a 6-yard touchdown run by running back Dominic Rhodes. The second quarter, though, was taken over by the Jets as they tied the game on QB Chad Pennington's 33-yard touchdown pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery, and took the lead on RB Kevan Barlow's 1-yard touchdown run. The Colts tied the game just before halftime on a 2-yard touchdown run by rookie RB Joseph Addai. After a scoreless third quarter, kicker Martin Gramatica, filling in for the injured Adam Vinatieri, made a 20-yard field goal early in the fourth to give Indianapolis the lead, 17-14. But New York regained the lead, scoring on a Kevan Barlow 5-yard touchdown score. Colts QB Peyton Manning rallied the Colts on their next possession, leading them on a scoring drive that led to a 2-yard touchdown pass to TE Bryan Fletcher. Illustrating perfectly the back-and-forth nature of the contest, the lead changed hands once again as DB Justin Miller returned the ensuing kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown to quickly move all the momentum to New York's side. But Indianapolis took the setback in stride as Manning methodically marched the Colts up the field and scored the game's final points on a 1-yard quarterback sneak. Facing a long field and with only eight seconds on the clock, on the game's last play Chad Pennington completed a pass up the middle to RB Leon Washington, who lateraled the ball to wide receiver Brad Smith in a desperate attempt to score a touchdown reminiscent of \"The Play\" between Stanford University and the University of California. Five laterals and three fumbles later, the Colts ended any hope of a Jets miracle comeback by recovering the final fumble of the play as time expired. Quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game 21 of 30 for 217 passing yards and one touchdown, Chad Pennington was 17 of 23 for 207 yards passing and had one touchdown pass and one interception.

{"question": "The Redskins hosted the Eagles in another NFC East matchup with both teams at 1-2. The Redskins started on offense, and running back Chris Thompson converted a 3rd-and-long with a 42-yard run into Eagles territory. Just 3 plays later, he took a short Cousins pass 19 yards to the 21-yard-line. They moved the ball down to the 2-yard-line, but could not score a touchdown. They took a 3-0 lead off of a Dustin Hopkins field goal. Philadelphia started shakily, losing 8 yards on their next drive before punting back to Washington. The Redskins were able to move from midfield down to the Eagles' 20-yard-line, but the drive again stalled in the redzone and they settled for another Hopkins field goal. Last year's NFL rushing leader DeMarco Murray rattled off a 30-yard gain on the Eagles' next possession, but the teams exchanged punts after it. After several short passes by Cousins got the Redskins inside the red zone yet again, the Redskins got a first down at the 1-yard-line after a pass interference call on Eagles rookie cornerback Eric Rowe. Kirk Cousins then ran the ball in for the first rushing touchdown of his career, and Washington led 13-0. On the Eagles' next drive, a Sam Bradford deep ball to rookie receiver Nelson Agholor was negated by a Ryan Mathews fumble that was recovered by Redskins linebacker Keenan Robinson on a trick play. After a Redskins punt (which speedy returner Darren Sproles returned to the Washington 30-yard-line), Bradford threw an apparent touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz that was nullified by an illegal formation penalty on Agholor. With all the momentum lost and a sack by Redskins rookie linebacker Preston Smith moving the Eagles back to the 25-yard-line, kicker Caleb Sturgis missed a short field goal to keep the score at 13-0. It was the first time the Redskins had shut out back-to-back home opponents in the first half since 1997. After driving to their own 38-yard-line, Philadelphia got the break they needed, with Bradford connecting with Riley Cooper for a 62-yard score. This cut the Redskins' lead to only 7 points, as Sturgis missed the extra point. Washington advanced the ball only 9 yards before punting back to the Eagles, who got the ball at their own 29-yard-line. Two Redskins penalties moved the ball 29 yards, and a 10-yard Bradford pass was caught by tight end Brent Celek to tie the game at 13-13. The Redskins retaliated by immediately getting into Eagles territory, courtesy of a 43-yard bomb from Kirk Cousins to rookie receiver Rashad Ross. Another rookie receiver, Jamison Crowder, got them inside the 20. From there, Hopkins kicked the ball through the uprights from 33 yards out, allowing Washington to regain its 16-13 advantage. The Redskins were quickly back in business after an Eagles punt, and now had a chance to go up by two scores, but Jordan Reed fumbled in Eagles territory to end the third quarter. Three plays later, Bradford burned the Redskins secondary on another deep ball, this one 39 yards to veteran wide receiver Miles Austin. More importantly, the Eagles took their first lead of the game, 20-16. The Redskins remained scoreless in the second half, punting from the Eagles' 35-yard-line instead of attempting a 53-yard field goal. The Eagles were barely able to cross midfield before punting back to Washington. With under 9 minutes remaining, they needed to regain some offensive momentum, but could not, going three-and-out. However, they were able to get a defensive stop, forcing the Eagles to go three-and-out as well. Alfred Morris runs of 16 and 13 yards got the offense rolling, and Pierre Gar&#231;on catches of 14 and 12 yards helped get Washington down to the Eagles' 4-yard-line with 35 seconds left. Cousins threw one incomplete pass to Crowder before connecting with Garcon for the game-winning touchdown and the 23-20 win. It was the second game-winning drive of Cousins' career, the first being Week 14 of the 2012 season against the Baltimore Ravens, when he entered the game in relief of the injured Robert Griffin III. This win was also Cousins' first division win, after previously going 0-5 against the Cowboys, Giants, and Eagles. With the win the Redskins moved to 2-2 for the season.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration.

{"question": "The smallest front of the war was in Catalonia. In 1689 the Duke of Noailles had led French forces there aimed at bringing further pressure to bear on the Spanish by re-igniting a peasant rising against Charles II, which initially broke out in 1687. Exploiting the situation, Noailles captured Camprodon on 22 May, but a larger Spanish army under the Duke of Villahermosa forced him to withdraw back to Roussillon in August. The Catalan campaign settled down in 1690, but a new front in Piedmont-Savoy proved more eventful. A ferment of religious animosities and Savoyard hatred of the French produced a theatre characterised by massacres and atrocities: constant guerrilla attacks by the armed populace were met by draconian reprisals. In 1690 Saint-Ruth took most of the Victor Amadeus II's exposed Duchy of Savoy, routing the Savoyard army in the process until only the great fortress of Montm\u00e9lian remained in ducal hands; while to the south in Piedmont, Nicolas Catinat led 12,000 men and soundly defeated Victor Amadeus at the Battle of Staffarda on 18 August.

In November 1939, the United States, who were taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies, amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort.

After a Steelers punt, the Patriots drove 61 yards in 8 plays, scoring on Ridley's 5-yard touchdown run, widening the lead to 41-24. Earlier on the drive, Ridley ran for 7 yards, making this his 5th-career 100-yard rushing game. The Steelers countered on their next drive, storming 80 yards in 10 plays, scoring Cotchery's third touchdown reception, trimming the deficit to 41-31. However, the Patriots were unstoppable. On the second play of the drive, after a 12-yard run by Blount, Brady hit Dobson for an 81-yard touchdown bomb, widening the lead to 48-31 late in the fourth quarter.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.

As part of a Franco-Ottoman alliance , French troops were supplied to the Ottomans in Hungary: a French artillery unit was dispatched in 1543-1544 and attached to the Ottoman Army. In August 1543, the Ottoman succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom The siege would be followed by the capture of the Hungarian coronation city of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in September 1543. Other cities that were captured during this campaign are Sikl\u00f3s and Szeged in order to better protect Buda.

{"question": "During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October.

{"question": "Henry Grey matriculated at Trinity College in 1615, and was granted an M.A. that year, during the visit of King James I of England. He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall. At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses. The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested, but was soon released.

{"question": "From the time of its start until the approach of World War II, the First World War was called simply the World War or the Great War and thereafter the First World War or World War I. At the time, it was also sometimes called \"the war to end war\" or \"the war to end all wars\" due to its then-unparalleled scale and devastation. In Canada, Maclean's magazine in October 1914 wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\" During the interwar period , the war was most often called the World War and the Great War in English-speaking countries. The term \"First World War\" was first used in September 1914 by the German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'\u00a0.. will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" citing a wire service report in The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914. After the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the terms World War I or the First World War became standard, with British and Canadian historians favouring the First World War, and Americans World War I. In the introduction to his book, Waterloo in 100 Objects, historian Gareth Glover states: \"This opening statement will cause some bewilderment to many who have grown up with the appellation of the Great War firmly applied to the 1914-18 First World War. But to anyone living before 1918, the title of the Great War was applied to the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars in which Britain fought France almost continuously for twenty-two years from 1793 to 1815.\" In 1911, the historian John Holland Rose published a book titled William Pitt and the Great War.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus.

{"question": "After World War II, amateur radio operators in the US started to receive obsolete but usable Teletype Model 26 equipment from commercial operators with the understanding that this equipment would not be used for or returned to commercial service. \"The Amateur Radioteletype and VHF Society\" was founded in 1946 in Woodside, NY. This organization soon changed its name to \"The VHF Teletype Society\" and started US Amateur Radio operations on 2 meters using audio frequency shift keying (AFSK). The first two-way amateur radioteletype Q code of record took place in May 1946 between Dave Winters, W2AUF, Brooklyn, NY and W2BFD, John Evans Williams, Woodside Long Island, NY. On the west coast, amateur RTTY also started on 2 meters. Operation on 80 meters, 40 meters and the other High Frequency (HF) amateur radio bands was initially accomplished using make and break keying since frequency shift keying (FSK) was not yet authorized. In early 1949, the first American transcontinental two-way RTTY QSO was accomplished on 11 meters using AFSK between Tom McMullen (W1QVF) operating at W1AW and Johnny Agalsoff, W6PSW. The stations effected partial contact on January 30, 1949, and repeated more successfully on January 31. On February 1, 1949, the stations exchanged solid print congratulatory message traffic and rag-chewed. Earlier, on January 23, 1949, William T. Knott, W2QGH, Larchmont, NY, had been able to make rough copy of W6PSWs test transmissions. While QSOs could be accomplished, it was quickly realized that FSK was technically superior to make and break keying. Due to the efforts of Merrill Swan, W6AEE, of \"The RTTY Society of Southern California\" publisher of RTTY and Wayne Green, W2NSD, of CQ Magazine, Amateur Radio operators successfully petitioned the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to amend Part 12 of the Regulations, which was effective on February 20, 1953. The amended Regulations permitted FSK in the non-voice parts of the 80, 40 and 20 meter bands and also specified the use of single channel 60 words-per-minute five unit code corresponding to ITA2. A shift of 850 hertz plus or minus 50 hertz was specified. Amateur Radio operators also had to identify their station callsign at the beginning and the end of each transmission and at ten-minute intervals using International Morse code. Use of this wide shift proved to be a problem for Amateur Radio operations. Commercial operators had already discovered that narrow shift worked best on the HF bands. After investigation and a petition to the FCC, Part 12 was amended, in March 1956, to allow Amateur Radio Operators to use any shift that was less than 900 hertz.

{"question": "Si Renfa's son Si Jifa escaped and continued independent action in another corner of southwest Yunnan. He sent his younger brother Zhaosai to seek pardon from Ming while at the same time he attacked Ming troops in early 1443. However they were defeated and he was forced to flee to Mong Yang. Zhaosai was kept as a hostage and the Ming retreated from Mong Mao. Seeing that Mong Mao was no longer occupied, Si Jifa returned to his father's base of power and began attacking neighboring tribes once again. The third punitive expedition was led by Wang Ji and launched in March 1443. Although the mission was to capture Si Jifa, negotiations on the return of Si Renfa had fallen ill. Ava demanded Ming territory for itself and Hsenwi in return of Si Renfa. Furthermore Ava had made peace with Si Jifa. Therefore, although the Ming army quickly defeated Si Jifa's base of power and captured his family, Si Jifa managed to escape to Mong Yang, and the Ming army decided not to pursue out of consideration of a combined Ava-Hsenwi attack on Ming forces. A compromise was finally reached between Ava and Ming in April 1445. Ava agreed to hand over Si Renfa in return for Ming support in annexing part of Hsenwi's territory.

{"question": "The expedition crossed the border on the night of April 21, 1919. The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railroad. The troops were divided into three groups and were made up of 1000 volunteers. The southern group advanced to Lodeynoye Pole in just three days, but was pressed back behind River Tuulos by Bolshevik troops. The northern group captured Pr\u00e4\u00e4s\u00e4.

Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \"subject\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140.

{"question": "The rebellion was ignited by the tax situation, where Eric showed arrogance by not negotiating with the four Estates of the Swedish realm at a Diet. In the summer of 1434, enraged miners and peasants burned the castle of Borgan\u00e4s near Borl\u00e4nge. The tension spread, causing several assaults on castles across the country. Nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson with mining interests in the Bergslagen area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army. Negotiations with Eric took place in Vadstena in August 1434, but were unsuccessful. In January 1435 Engelbrekt summoned representatives from the four Estates to a Diet in Arboga, which later has been called the first Riksdag of the Estates. Engelbrekt was elected Captain of the Swedish realm. The antagonism abated when Eric promised changes for the better. However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm, where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city. A certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the Nobility and Clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 had risen to the position of Riksh\u00f6vitsman. Neither dared remove Engelbrekt completely because of his strong support among the two lower Estates . However, Engelbrekt fell sick and became less active.

{"question": "The Bears opened the season at home against the Buffalo Bills, who had a record of 6-10 in 2013. Entering the game, the Bears were 54-35-5 in season openers, the most wins of any team, and they had not lost an opening game since 2009, the most in the NFC and second-most in the NFL behind the New England Patriots. The Bears were 7-4 against the Bills, with their last meeting being a 22-19 victory in Toronto in 2010, while winning 40-7 in the last game between the two at Soldier Field; the Bears had won all five meetings between the two in Chicago. When comparing the two teams in 2013 statistically, the Bears had the advantage in three offensive categories (points scored, total offense, and passing offense), while the Bills had the second-best rushing offense, compared to the Bears' 16th-ranked rushing game. On defense, the Bears were outmatched in all three categories (total defense, rushing defense, and passing defense), but are one spot higher than Buffalo in turnover ratio (+5 to +3). Scout.com's Jeremy Stoltz writes that one of the players the Bears must contain is the defensive tackle duo of Mario Williams and Marcell Dareus, who had a combined 139 total tackles, 18.0 sacks and two forced fumbles during 2013. While the Bears' offensive line boasted the fourth-least sacks, none of the five starters played in the preseason. As a result, to combat the rush, the Bears need Jay Cutler to release the ball quickly. For the Bears' defense, Stoltz stated all the Bears needed to do was stop Buffalo's running backs Fred Jackson and C. J. Spiller, as the Bills had the second-best rushing attack in the league. The Bears were favored to win by seven points, the third-largest spread of the week. Matt Fort&#233;, Charles Tillman, and Robbie Gould were the captains for the game. David Fales, Kelvin Hayden, Tony Fiammetta, Khaseem Greene, Charles Leno, Jr., David Bass and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and elected to kick. After Buffalo punted, Chicago scored on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, which the Bills retaliated with E. J. Manuel's two-yard touchdown run. On the Bears' first drive of the second quarter, Brandon Marshall fumbled, with linebacker Preston Brown recovering; the Bills would score on Dan Carpenter's 50-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler was intercepted by former Bear Corey Graham after Bennett did not \"turn to look for the ball in time\", with the Bills again capitalizing on the takeaway, with Manuel's seven-yard touchdown pass to Spiller, and the half ended with Buffalo leading 17-7. On the Bears' first possession of the third quarter, Gould kicked a five-yard field goal, and on the Bills' first drive of the half, Chris Conte read a pass intended for Marquise Goodwin, stepping in front of the pass to intercept the ball. On Chicago's ensuing drive, the offense rallied to tie the score on Cutler's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall. In the fourth quarter, the Bears drove from their own six-yard line to reach the Buffalo 34, but Cutler's forced pass intended for Bennett was intercepted by Kyle Williams; Carpenter would kick a 33-yard field goal, which the Bears responded with Gould's 37-yarder. The Bills would kneel to end regulation with a 20-20 score. After the Bears went three-and-out, the Bills started on their own 22-yard line, but drove to the Bears' 39. On the next play, Jackson found a hole in the line of scrimmage, getting past Lance Briggs. Conte reached Jackson at the 20-yard line, but was stiff-armed; Conte attempted to tackle again, but was knocked down, with Jackson being pushed out of bounds at the one-yard line. Two plays later, Carpenter kicked the game-winning 27-yard field goal. Four of the Bears' offensive starters suffered injuries during the game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) did not play after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, \"It was a play where it's the end of the game - I've got to get the ball out or something. If I hit him, it's a field goal no matter what, so I've got to try and get the ball out. It's a desperation play where I've got to try and punch the ball or something.\".

{"question": "Kabuls population is estimated to have been about 10,000 in 1700, 65,000 by 1878, and 120,000 by 1940. More recently, the population was around 500,000 in 1979, whilst another source claims 337,715 as of 1976. This figure rose to about 1.5 million by 1988, before dramatically dropping in the 1990s. Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the Taliban regime, and partly due to Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid urbanization mean that many residents today live in informal settlements. Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid. Although the settlements are illegal, they have been tolerated by authorities.

{"question": "The Colts traveled to The Meadowlands for a showdown with the New York Jets. This would be the second time this season that the Colts played at Giants Stadium, as they played the New York Giants in the regular season opener. Indianapolis scored first on a 6-yard touchdown run by running back Dominic Rhodes. The second quarter, though, was taken over by the Jets as they tied the game on QB Chad Pennington's 33-yard touchdown pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery, and took the lead on RB Kevan Barlow's 1-yard touchdown run. The Colts tied the game just before halftime on a 2-yard touchdown run by rookie RB Joseph Addai. After a scoreless third quarter, kicker Martin Gramatica, filling in for the injured Adam Vinatieri, made a 20-yard field goal early in the fourth to give Indianapolis the lead, 17-14. But New York regained the lead, scoring on a Kevan Barlow 5-yard touchdown score. Colts QB Peyton Manning rallied the Colts on their next possession, leading them on a scoring drive that led to a 2-yard touchdown pass to TE Bryan Fletcher. Illustrating perfectly the back-and-forth nature of the contest, the lead changed hands once again as DB Justin Miller returned the ensuing kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown to quickly move all the momentum to New York's side. But Indianapolis took the setback in stride as Manning methodically marched the Colts up the field and scored the game's final points on a 1-yard quarterback sneak. Facing a long field and with only eight seconds on the clock, on the game's last play Chad Pennington completed a pass up the middle to RB Leon Washington, who lateraled the ball to wide receiver Brad Smith in a desperate attempt to score a touchdown reminiscent of \"The Play\" between Stanford University and the University of California. Five laterals and three fumbles later, the Colts ended any hope of a Jets miracle comeback by recovering the final fumble of the play as time expired. Quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game 21 of 30 for 217 passing yards and one touchdown, Chad Pennington was 17 of 23 for 207 yards passing and had one touchdown pass and one interception.

After trading interceptions, with Corey Webster picking Matt Hasselbeck and Ken Hamlin intercepting Manning, the Seahawks jumped out to a quick 7-0 lead on a 2-yard touchdown run by Shaun Alexander. After forcing a punt, Hasselbeck tossed a 12-yard touchdown to Nate Burleson.

{"question": "During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.

Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful.

The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27\u00a0May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck. In November 1939, the United States, who were taking measures to assist China and the Western Allies, amended the Neutrality Act to allow \"cash and carry\" purchases by the Allies. In 1940, following the German capture of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the US to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoted Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort. The US started strategic planning to prepare for a full scale offensive against Germany. At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy and Germany as the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.

While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale.

{"question": "Si Renfa's son Si Jifa escaped and continued independent action in another corner of southwest Yunnan. He sent his younger brother Zhaosai to seek pardon from Ming while at the same time he attacked Ming troops in early 1443. However they were defeated and he was forced to flee to Mong Yang. Zhaosai was kept as a hostage and the Ming retreated from Mong Mao. Seeing that Mong Mao was no longer occupied, Si Jifa returned to his father's base of power and began attacking neighboring tribes once again. The third punitive expedition was led by Wang Ji and launched in March 1443. Although the mission was to capture Si Jifa, negotiations on the return of Si Renfa had fallen ill. Ava demanded Ming territory for itself and Hsenwi in return of Si Renfa. Furthermore Ava had made peace with Si Jifa. Therefore, although the Ming army quickly defeated Si Jifa's base of power and captured his family, Si Jifa managed to escape to Mong Yang, and the Ming army decided not to pursue out of consideration of a combined Ava-Hsenwi attack on Ming forces. A compromise was finally reached between Ava and Ming in April 1445. Ava agreed to hand over Si Renfa in return for Ming support in annexing part of Hsenwi's territory.

During the night of 13-14 February, the Japanese attempted to block the entrance to Port Arthur by sinking several concrete-filled steamers in the deep water channel to the port, but they sank too deep to be effective. A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3-4 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral Makarov had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade. On 12 April 1904, two Russian pre-dreadnought battleships, the flagship Petropavlovsk and the Pobeda, slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The Petropavlovsk sank almost immediately, while the Pobeda had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, perished on the battleship Petropavlovsk. On 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British war correspondents who were taking the ship Haimun into warzones to report for the London-based Times newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet.

{"question": "This time, Pagan could not do anything to retake Martaban because it was facing an existential threat from the north. The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

In the 19th century, Taunton was also the center of an important iron-making industry, utilizing much bog iron from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves , tacks  and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works  also operated in the city during this time. Taunton was also home to several textile mills  and other industries, such as felt  and brick making. During the 19th century, Taunton was a major shipping point for grain from the inland rural farm areas of Massachusetts to the rest of the nation via Weir Village and the Taunton River. With the advent of the railroad, Taunton would also become an important transportation hub due to its central location.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia  returned to Poland.

{"question": "During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors  between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.

{"question": "Precise measurements of atmospheric Absorption (electromagnetic radiation) were not made until 1888 and 1904. The temperature Stefan obtained was a median value of previous ones, 1950 \u00b0C and the absolute thermodynamic one 2200 K. As 2.574  43.5, it follows from the law that the temperature of the Sun is 2.57 times greater than the temperature of the lamella, so Stefan got a value of 5430 \u00b0C or 5700 K (the modern value is 5778 K). This was the first sensible value for the temperature of the Sun. Before this, values ranging from as low as 1800 \u00b0C to as high as 13,000,000 \u00b0C were claimed. The lower value of 1800 \u00b0C was determined by Claude Pouillet (1790\u20131868) in 1838 using the Dulong\u2013Petit law. Pouillet also took just half the value of the Suns correct energy flux.

Isolated incidents continued to occur particularly along the ROKA-controlled sectors of the DMZ, but it had become clear that the North had abandoned its hopes of starting an insurgency in the South. Qualitative improvements in the ROK Army meant that the U.S. could start to contemplate reducing its military presence in South Korea. On 25 July 1969, President Nixon announced his Nixon Doctrine that, henceforth, the U.S. expected its allies to defend themselves with U.S. air and seapower support , but not U.S. ground troops. While aimed primarily at South Vietnam, this policy would also apply to South Korea . On 1 October 1969 General Bonesteel handed over command of USFK to General John H. Michaelis.

While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.

In the third quarter, Detroit increased its lead as Orlovsky completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson.  However, Minnesota answered when QB Gus Frerotte completed an 86-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian.  In the fourth quarter, the Vikings sealed the win when kicker Ryan Longwell nailed the game-winning 26-yard field goal. Dan Orlovsky's run out of the end zone for a safety topped the list of ESPN's Not Top 10 of 2008. On October 14, the Lions traded wide receiver Roy Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for three picks in the 2009 NFL Draft.

{"question": "Hoping to build on their win over the Houston Texans, the Cowboys stayed at home for a Monday Night match-up with their NFC East rival, the New York Giants.  On the Giants opening drive, Eli Manning threw a 50-yard touchdown to Plaxico Burress.  Later in the first quarter after Jeff Feagles punted inside the one-yard line, LaVar Arrington sacked Drew Bledsoe in the endzone for a safety. In the second quarter, Giants kicker Jay Feely kicked a 31-yard field goal.  Dallas would score before halftime as Bledsoe ran 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak.  Bledsoe also threw a costly interception just before halftime that would have given the Cowboys a 14-12 lead at the break.  Due to Bledsoe's abysmal performance, head coach Bill Parcells replaced him with backup quarterback Tony Romo at the start of the second half.  Not much had changed for the Giants in the third quarter as Manning threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Shockey and Brandon Jacobs got a 3-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Romo completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens, and Romo ran into the endzone for a two-point conversion.  The Giants pulled away as Feely kicked a 32-yard field goal, while rookie cornerback Kevin Dockery would return an interception 96 yards for a touchdown.

The final attempt by Sigismund and W\u0142adys\u0142aw to gain the throne was a new campaign launched on 6 April 1617. W\u0142adys\u0142aw was the nominal commander, but it was hetman Chodkiewicz who had actual control over the army. In October, the towns of Dorogobuzh  and Vyazma  surrendered quickly, recognizing W\u0142adys\u0142aw as the tsar. However, the Commonwealth forces suffered defeats between Vyazma and Mozhaisk, and Chodkiewicz's plans for a counterattack and an advance to Moscow failed. W\u0142adys\u0142aw did not have enough forces to advance to Moscow again, especially because the Russian support  for the Poles was all but gone by that time. In response to W\u0142adys\u0142aw's invasion, the burghers of Smolensk revolted against Polish rule, and the Polish troops had to fight their way back as they retreated from the city. However, in 1617 Polish forces, besieged in Smolensk  by Russian forces, were relieved by Lisowczycy, when Russian forces retreated to Bely soon after receiving news that Lisowczycy, then commanded by Stanis\u0142aw Czapi\u0144ski, had appeared in the area. In 1618 Petro Sahaidachny's campaign against Muscovy resulted in sacking numerous forts such as Putivl, Kursk, Yelets, and others. Together with Chodkiewicz he laid siege to Moscow in September 1618.

Indianapolis grabbed the lead for the first time in the game during the third quarter on QB Peyton Manning's 30-yard touchdown pass to TE Dallas Clark.

{"question": "Week ten featured the Bears attempting to avoid suffering the first sweep by the Lions since 2007, while also trying to claim the division lead; the last time the two teams faced each other in a late-season game for the division lead was in 1991, which ended in a Chicago 20-10 win. However, the Bears had won the last five games against the Lions at Soldier Field. On November 7, Marc Trestman announced that Jay Cutler has been cleared by doctors to return against Detroit, despite having been projected to be out for approximately four weeks. Against the Lions, Cutler was 7-2, and won all four home games. On the offensive side, Jeff Joniak states that the Lions defensive line \"are ferocious up the middle, they are physical, and they make you pay for poor technique,\" but that \"there is growing confidence that the Bears offense is a resilient one;\" the Bears had the fewest pre-snap penalties in the league, and only one false start. The Bears could also seize the Lions' cornerback corps, which struggled during the season, allowing 11 plays of 40 yards or more, along with 4.7 yards per carry. Defensively, Sports Illustrated writers Chris Burke and Doug Farrar wrote the Bears must attempt to hinder Reggie Bush, and improve their performance from the previous week, when the Packers' running game ran for 190 yards and two touchdowns. The Bears also had to prevent Calvin Johnson from excelling; against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson recorded 329 receiving yards. Chicago scored first after Cutler's 32-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall capped a 65-yard drive that took just 2:23. However, the Lions would travel 85 yards to tie on Matthew Stafford's 5-yard pass to Kris Durham. In the following quarter, the Bears reached the Lions' 4-yard line, but Cutler's pass was tipped by Ndamukong Suh, and intercepted by DeAndre Levy in the endzone; both teams would fail to score in the quarter. During the quarter, Cutler began showing signs of struggling due to an ankle injury. In the third quarter, the Lions would score on Stafford's four-yard touchdown to Johnson. Afterwards, the Bears were forced to settle for a 25-yard field goal, narrowing the gap to one point. In the fourth, Stafford was intercepted by Chris Conte, who reached Detroit's 9-yard line, and Cutler would then throw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery, which was eventually nullified. After an incomplete pass, Gould kicked a 32-yard field goal to draw the score to 14-13. However, Johnson would catch a 14-yard pass from Stafford to increase the lead to 21-13, and with 2:22 remaining, Josh McCown entered the game in favor of Cutler, and guided the Bears' offense 74 yards, culminating in McCown's 11-yard touchdown pass to Marshall with 40 seconds to go. On the two-point conversion, McCown's pass to tight end Dante Rosario fell incomplete, but Willie Young was penalized for roughing the passer, allowing the Bears a second chance, which failed after Matt Fort&#233; was tackled by Nick Fairley in the backfield. The Bears' onside kick would backfire, as Joique Bell recovered, sealing a season sweep for the Lions. Despite stating he was \"100 percent\" healthy after the groin injury suffered two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass during the third quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up.  Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, \"It held up OK. It's all on the same leg so I think that was a problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think.\" Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.

The French were only slowly expelled. On 1 February 1473, John entered Perpignan to the joy of its citizens. He placed Catalan garrisons in the castles of Bellegarde, Collioure, and Salses. The French, angered by the abridgement of the treaty of Bayonne, counter-attacked a few weeks later, but some Castilian troops under Prince Ferdinand successfully resisted. John began negotiations that led to a truce in July and a treaty at Perpignan on 17 September. John recognised the treaty of Bayonne in return for French recognition of his sovereignty in the disputed provinces. John agreed to pay 300,000 \u00e9cus, and Roussillon and Cerdagne were proclaimed \"neutral\" until the payment was made. John returned to Barcelona triumphant, but failed to raise the necessary funds. In the summer of 1474 the French conquered Roussillon and March 1475 Perpignan fell to them.

Cloistered below decks in cages which held 50 internees, the prisoners were forced to use broken toilets which overflowed frequently into their communal area. Deprived of tables, the already weakened men ate off the floor, frequently succumbing to disease and illness as a result.  There were several hunger strikes, including a major strike involving upwards of 150 men in the winter of 1923. By February 1923, under the 1922 Special Powers Act the British were detaining 263 men on the Argenta, which was moored in Belfast Lough. This was supplemented with internment at other land based sites such as Larne workhouse, Belfast Prison and Derry Gaol.

{"question": "Those who landed at Skagway made their way over the White Pass before cutting across to Bennett Lake. Although the trail began gently, it progressed over several mountains with paths as narrow as 2 feet  and in wider parts covered with boulders and sharp rocks. Under these conditions horses died in huge numbers, giving the route the informal name of Dead Horse Trail. The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds  packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail.

This replaced the Constitution of the Irish Free State and called the state Ireland, or \u00c9ire in Irish. While Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution defined the national territory to be the whole island, they also confined the state's jurisdiction to the area that had been the Irish Free State. The former Irish Free State government had abolished the Office of Governor-General in December 1936. Although the constitution established the office of President of Ireland, the question over whether Ireland was a republic remained open. Diplomats were accredited to the king, but the president exercised all internal functions of a head of state. For instance, the President gave assent to new laws with his own authority, without reference to King George VI who was only an \"organ\", that was provided for by statute law. Ireland remained neutral during World War II, a period it described as the Emergency. Ireland's link with the Commonwealth was terminated with the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and declared that the state was a republic. At the time, a declaration of a republic terminated Commonwealth membership. This rule was changed 10 days after Ireland declared itself a republic, with the London Declaration of 28 April 1949.

{"question": "After the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century, possession of the kingdom again changed hands. Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, Naples was given to Charles VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. When Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, Ferdinand IV. Despite the two Kingdoms being in a personal union under the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasts, they remained constitutionally separate. Being a member of the House of Bourbon, Ferdinand IV was a natural opponent of the French Revolution and Napoleon. In 1798, he briefly occupied Rome, but was expelled from it by French Revolutionary forces within the year. Soon afterwards Ferdinand fled to Sicily. In January 1799 the French armies installed a Parthenopaean Republic, but this proved short-lived, and a peasant counter-revolution inspired by the clergy allowed Ferdinand to return to his capital. However, in 1801 Ferdinand was compelled to make important concessions to the French by the Treaty of Florence, which reinforced France's position as the dominant power in mainland Italy.

{"question": "The Panthers came into Week 3 in need of a win in order to save their season. This game would be against the Jacksonville Jaguars, who had gone 8-8 last season and were 1-1 to start the season in 2011. The Jaguars would bench Luke McCown and start rookie Blaine Gabbert after McCown's disastrous 4 interceptions in a devastating 32-3 loss to the New York Jets. The Panthers would start the game by sacking Gabbert and getting a safety, to lead 2-0. With the score 5-3, one of the more memorable moments during the season occurred. A heavy rain started coming down, blanketing the stadium and flooding the concrete decks. Players slipped and slid all over the place, water going everywhere. Most dramatically, the excess water on the stadium's upper deck poured onto the lower deck which poured onto the field. Although the field had a drainage system, it was not designed for such an amount of water at once. Moments later, a Gabbert pass was picked off by Carolina's Sherrod Martin. However, for those watching the game on TV it was difficult to tell who picked the pass off or where he was. The reason was CBS' main camera feed was covered with so many raindrops that identifying specific players on the field was nearly impossible. Viewers, therefore, had to rely on the call from play-by-play announcer Spero Dedes as to exactly what was happening on the play. Subsequent replays gave them a clearer picture. With 0:06 left in the 1st half, Blaine Gabbert threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Mike Thomas which was both the first career touchdown pass by Blaine Gabbert and the first touchdown pass for the Jaguars in the 2011 season. Jacksonville would go up 10-5 at halftime, however, Carolina would come back. With 6:05 left in the 4th quarter, and the rain not coming down anymore although the field, players, and fans were still soaked, Cam Newton finally found Steve Smith for a gain of 13 yards. On the same drive, with 4:27 left, on a 3rd and 2, Cam Newton found his new tight end, Greg Olsen, for a 16-yard touchdown pass to put the Panthers up 14-10.

{"question": "The first United States occupation of the Dominican Republic lasted from 1916 to 1924. It was one of the many interventions in Latin America undertaken by the military forces of the United States in the 20th century. On May 13, 1916, Rear Admiral William B. Caperton forced the Dominican Republic's Secretary of War Desiderio Arias, who had seized power from Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra, to leave Santo Domingo by threatening the city with naval bombardment. The first major engagement occurred at Las Trencheras on June 27. There the Dominican rebels had dug trenches on two hills, one behind the other, blocking the road to Santiago. The field guns of Captain Chandler Campbell's 13th Company, along with a machine gun platoon, took position on a hill commanding the enemy trenches and opened fire. Under the cover of this fire, the Marine infantry charged the defenders' first line, covered until the last possible moment by the artillery barrage. The insurgents fled to their trenches on the second hill. They rallied there briefly, then broke and ran again as the American field guns resumed shelling. Within 45 minutes from the opening artillery shots, the Marines, at a cost to themselves of one killed and four wounded, had overrun the enemy positions. They found no dead or weapons in the trenches but later discovered five rebel bodies in the nearby woods. This engagement set the pattern for most Marine contacts with hostile forces in the Dominican Republic.

{"question": "After their loss to Atlanta, Washington hosted the Minnesota Vikings, looking to snap an 8-game home losing streak. The first quarter was dominated by the Vikings, as they reached the redzone three times and intercepted Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III. However, the Redskins defense was able to stiffen in the redzone, holding the Vikings to three Blair Walsh field goals of 20, 27, and 27 yards, to give the Vikings a 9-0 advantage after one quarter. In the second, Washington finally was able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having replaced Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard boot to trim the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington was able to run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9. In the third, Washington continued imposing its will, as they drove down the field again, this time culminating in a Robert Griffin III touchdown run, his fifth rushing touchdown of the year, setting a Washington Redskins record for rushing touchdowns by a Redskins QB and extending the Washington advantage to 24-9. The Vikings would not back down, though, and Blair Walsh connected again, this time from 37 yards, his fourth field goal on the day, to cut into the lead, and make it 24-12. In the fourth, the Vikings possessed the ball, but Ponder threw an interception straight into the waiting arms of Redskins free safety Madieu Williams, who returned it 24 yards to put the game nearly on ice, at 31-12 Washington. The Vikings, however, proved resilient. On their ensuing drive, the Vikings found the endzone for the first time on the day, with Ponder finding wide receiver Michael Jenkins for a 9-yard score. Ponder subsequently found Kyle Rudolph on a successful two-point conversion attempt, and the Redskins lead was cut to 31-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Minnesota got the ball back. Once again, Minnesota scored, this time Ponder found Rudolph to cut the lead to 31-26. This time, however, the two-point conversion came up short, meaning Minnesota would again need to score a touchdown to complete its rally. However, Washington's rookie QB would see to it that no comeback would be complete on his team on this day, as Griffin, on 3rd-and-6 from his own 24, found a seam on a designed quarterback draw, and raced down the sideline for a 76-yard touchdown run, the longest such rush TD by a QB since Kordell Stewart scrambled for an 80-yard score against the Carolina Panthers in the 1996 season. With the score now 38-26 Redskins, the Vikings tried to rally again, and were able to reach the Redskins' goal line. However, with less than a half minute remaining, DeAngelo Hall intercepted Christian Ponder, to officially preserve the 38-26 win.

The Guajiros recognized him and forced his party to take refuge in the house of the curate, which they then set afire. Sierra and eight of his men were killed. This success was soon known in other Guajiro areas, and more men joined the revolt. According to Mess\u00eda, at the peak there were 20,000 Wayuus under arms. Many had firearms acquired from English and Dutch smugglers, sometimes even from the Spanish. This enabled the rebels to take nearly all the settlements of the region, which they burned. According to the authorities, more than 100 Spaniards were killed and many others taken prisoner. Many cattle were also taken by the rebels. The Spaniards took refuge in Riohacha and sent urgent messages to Maracaibo, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Cartagena, the latter responding by sending 100 troops. The rebels themselves were not unified. Sierra's relatives among the Indians took up arms against the rebels to avenge his death. A battle between the two groups of Wayuus was fought at La Soledad.

King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.

The Mongol Yoke ended in 1480 with the defeat of Akhmat Khan of the Golden Horde in the Great stand on the Ugra river. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests. Around 1486-87, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian-Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Muscovy, allied with Me\u00f1li I Giray, khan of the Crimean Khanate. Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk; raided Mosalsk; and attacked territory of the Dukes of Vyazma. Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians. Ivan III officially declared war in 1493, but the conflict soon ended. Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate a peace treaty. An \"eternal\" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494. The agreement marked the first Lithuanian territorial losses to Moscow: the Principality of Vyazma and a sizable region in the upper reaches of the Oka River. The lost area was estimated to be approximately 87,000\u00a0km2 . A day before the official confirmation of the treaty, Alexander Jagiellon was betrothed to Helena, daughter of Ivan III .

{"question": "In week seven, the Packers traveled to Cleveland, Ohio to face the 1-5 Cleveland Browns at Cleveland Browns Stadium. The Browns started off the contest with the ball at their own 45-yard line after Packers kicker Mason Crosby kicked the ball out of bounds on the opening kickoff. The Browns couldn't manage to move the ball effectively on their first possession though failing to convert their first third down of the game and had to settle for a punt. After the punt the Packers took over at their own 14-yard line and ran the ball on ten of the eleven plays of their first drive, moving the ball all the way down to the Cleveland 32-yard line where backup running back Brandon Jackson came up a yard short on a third and three. The Packers offense stayed on the field and quarterback Aaron Rodgers attempted a quarterback sneak up the middle but the attempt failed to gain any yards and the ball was turned over on downs. Cleveland's second drive of the game was more successful than the previous, with the biggest gain of the drive coming on a 22-yard pass from quarterback Derek Anderson to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi who beat Packers cornerback Al Harris on a square in route. Harris also grabbed Massaquoi's face mask on the tackle and the Packers were penalized 15 yards for the infraction. The Browns managed to advance the ball down deep into the red zone, but the Packers defense held the Browns out of the end zone and forced them to settle for a 22-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter that hit the upright but deflected through to give the Browns an early 3-0 lead. On the Packers' next drive, Aaron Rodgers and company moved the ball down to the Cleveland 48-yard line with a short pass to Donald Lee, a 13-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 6-yard pass to Greg Jennings. The drive was capped off with a short right pass from Aaron Rodgers to linebacker turned tight end Spencer Havner. Havner pulled in the pass and ran down the right sideline 45 yards for a touchdown to claim a 7-3 Packers lead. The Browns then took over on offense trying to reclaim the lead from the Packers. After two incompletions and a 5-yard pass completion the Browns failed to reach the first down marker and looked to end the offensive series on a three and out. On the punt however, the Packers were penalized 5 yards for having 12 men on the field of play which gave the Browns a first down. The Browns still failed to capitalize on the Packers mistake by only gaining 4 yards on the next three plays and settled for another punt. The Packers offense took over again at their own 14. On first down, running back Ryan Grant rushed for 6 yards and 4 on second down, but tight end Donald Lee was flagged for holding on the second rushing attempt, moving the Packers back 10 yards. Lee made up for his mistake on the new play though, hauling in a 19-yard reception for a first down. On the next play, Rodgers dropped back to pass and hit Donald Driver in stride between two defenders. Driver accelerated down field past an oncoming safety and into the end zone for a 71-yard touchdown to increase the Packers lead to 14-3. The Browns offense took to the field to try to out-fox the Packers defense. On the sixth play of the drive though, quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in which he returned down to the Browns 15-yard line for a 25-yard return. Ryan Grant then rushed the ball for nine yards on second down to the Browns 3-yard line to set up first and goal at the three. After an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings, Ryan Grant rushed for 2 more yards on second down falling a yard short of the touchdown. Rodgers then passed to Donald Driver on third and one but the pass was incomplete. Fortunately, the Browns defender covering Driver was flagged for pass inference and the Packer were rewarded with a first and goal at the 1-yard line. After a Grant run for no gain and a John Kuhn rush for no gain, Ryan Grant then managed to break the goal line on third down to score a touchdown for the Packers extending the lead even more to 21-3. The Browns took over with less than a minute remaining in the half but managed to have to settle for one final hail Mary attempt into the end zone which was batted down incomplete to end the half with the Packers leading 21-3. After the half, the Packers started out with possession and managed to move the ball down to the Browns 37-yard line with multiple short yardage gains both passing and rushing. After an offensive pass interference penalty on Donald Lee, the Packers failed to convert on third and 20 and had to settle for a 55-yard field goal attempt on which kicker Mason Crosby missed wide left. The Browns then took over after the missed attempt and running back Jamal Lewis rushed for 4 yards on first and 4 on second down to set the Browns up with a 3rd and 2 on the Packers 47. On third down, Anderson dropped back to pass and threw a ball short right to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Charles Woodson immediately hit Cribbs knocking the ball out of his possession. The ball was recovered by the Packers at the Packers 48 by Packers linebacker Brandon Chillar. The Packers offense then got into another string of multiple rushing attempts in which was started out with a 15-yard carry by Grant.  Rodgers also completed a 16-yard pass to Donald Lee on the drive which stalled when a short pass to Ryan Grant on third down  and four only gained three yards down to the Browns 1-yard line. Crosby came onto the field and converted a chip shot field goal to extend the Packers lead to 24-3. The Browns managed to move the ball much more effectively than previous attempts on their corresponding drive moving the ball all the way down into the red zone. In the drive that in which extended into the fourth quarter, The Browns offense was held on four straight attempts inside the Packers four-yard line. The drive ended when the Browns choose to go for it on fourth down at the one, but the Anderson pass flew over wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi and out of the back of the end zone. The Packers then took over at their own 1-yard line and managed to move the ball 99 yards for another touchdown. The drive was highlighted by an 18-yard pass to Jennings, a 14-yard pass to Spencer Havner and a 19-yard scamper by Aaron Rodgers down to the Browns 39-yard line. Ryan Grant broke loose on the next play of the drive for 37 yards down the right sideline to the Browns 5-yard line. Rodgers then connected with James Jones in the lower left corner of the end zone for the final touchdown of the game, which extended the lead to 31-3. Both teams then continued to exchange rather meaningless possessions with the Packers offense now being run by backup quarterback Matt Flynn. The Packers final drive of the game started with 5:52 remaining on the clock and multiple rush attempts along with a Flynn pass to Jennings for 12 yards ran the clock down to 35 seconds. The Browns took over and rushed the ball once in which the game clock then expired to give the Packers their second successive victory, this time 31-3 over the Cleveland Browns. During the contest second-year tight end Jermichael Finley and fourth-string wide receiver Brett Swain both were removed for the game because of knee injuries.

Champions Kees Verkerk and Ard Schenk were immensely popular, causing a real speed skating hype in the country. Successes continue up to today, with the likes of Yvonne van Gennip (3 Olympic gold medals in 1988), Rintje Ritsma (4-time World Allround Champion), Jochem Uytdehaage (2 Olympic gold medals in 2002), Marianne Timmer (3 Olympic gold medals in 1998 and 2006), Ireen W\u00fcst (5 Olympic golds in 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 6 World Allround Speed Skating Championships) and Sven Kramer (4 Olympic gold medals in 2010, 2014, 2018 and 9 World Allround Championships). The Dutch speed skaters performance at the 2014 Winter Olympics, where they won 8 out of 12 events, 23 out of 36 medals, including 4 clean sweeps, is the most dominant performance in a single sport in Olympic history. Thialf Stadium in Heerenveen was the second indoor 400m speed skating oval in the world, the first to host an international championship and remains a world-class facility today.

{"question": "After the Bills punted on their opening drive, the Patriots drove 48 yards to the Bills 25 and Gostkowski was good on a 43-yard field goal. On the second play of the Bills next drive, Fitzpatrick was strip-sacked by Wilfork with Cunningham recovering at the Patriots 13. Three plays later, Ridley scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 10-0. The Bills responded by driving to the Patriots 23 and Lindell was good on a 41-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 10-3. This led to four straight touchdown drives before halftime. The Patriots responded by racing 83 yards in 8 plays with Woodhead scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 17-3. The Bills answered right back, racing 80 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on a 14-yard run by Jackson, trimming the deficit to 17-10. The Patriots drove 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 12-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, upping the lead to 24-10. The Bills weren't done though, marching 75 yards in 11 plays, scoring on Fitzpatrick's two-yard touchdown pass to Chandler, bringing the deficit to 24-17 at halftime. The Patriots drove to the Bills 31, but on 3rd-and-5, Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams sacked Brady for a 7-yard loss and the Patriots punted rather than attempt a 56-yard field goal. After a Bills punt, aided by an unnecessary roughness penalty bringing the ball to the Bills 39, the Patriots needed just four plays to go 39 yards, scoring on Brady's 18-yard screen pass to Woodhead, his first multi-touchdown game of his career, making the score 31-17.

The Bills drove to the Patriots 13, but Jackson was stripped by McCourty at the 1 and Arrington recovered. The Patriots were forced to punt, and the Bills raced 55 yards in a minute-and-a-half, scoring on Fitzpatrick's 2-yard touchdown pass to Jones, trimming the deficit to just 34-31. Edelman returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Patriots 32, and the Patriots drove to the Bills 9, but the Bills defense kept the Patriots out of the end zone, giving the Bills a chance down just 37-31.

{"question": "This time, Pagan could not do anything to retake Martaban because it was facing an existential threat from the north. The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria.

{"question": "After Oakland began the game with a 3-and-out, Denver sustained a long drive deep into Oakland territory. However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful.

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed. Some soldiers committed suicide due to the conditions prevalent in the army.

{"question": "The peace Treaty of Limerick signed on 3 October 1691 offered favourable terms to Jacobites willing to stay in Ireland and give an oath of loyalty to William III. Peace was concluded on these terms between Sarsfield and Ginkell, giving toleration to Catholicism and full legal rights to Catholics that swore an oath of loyalty to William III and Mary II. The Protestant-dominated Irish Parliament refused to ratify the articles of the Treaty in 1697, and from 1695 on, updated the penal laws, which discriminated harshly against Catholics. Catholics saw this as a severe breach of faith. A popular contemporary Irish saying was, cuimhnig\u00ed Luimneach agus feall na Sassanaigh . The Papacy was an enemy of Louis of France and therefore did not support James in 1691, but the new Pope Pope Innocent XII changed its policy to support for France, and therefore James, from 1693. This factor hardened Protestant attitudes towards Catholics and Jacobitism in Ireland. Part of the treaty agreed to Sarsfield's demand that the Jacobite army could leave Ireland as a body and go to France. Ships were even provided for this purpose. This event was popularly known in Ireland as the \"Flight of the Wild Geese\". Around 14,000 men with around 10,000 women and children left Ireland with Patrick Sarsfield in 1691. Initially, they formed the army in exile of James II, though operating as part of the French army. After James' death, the remnants of this force merged into the French Irish Brigade, which had been set up in 1689 from 6,000 Irish recruits sent by the Irish Jacobites in return for French military aid.

{"question": "The kingdom of Assam was the last conquest of Bodawpaya. In December 1816, he sent a 16,000-strong force to Assam to install his nominee, Chandra Kanta Singh, to the Assamese throne. From their northernmost forts in Hukawng Valley in present-day northern Kachin State, the Burmese army crossed the 9,000-foot high Himalayan Patkai range, and finally entered Assam in early 1817. The army decisively defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Kathalguri, near the Assamese capital Jorhat. A pro-Burmese minister Badan Chandra was installed, with Singh as the nominal king. The army left in April 1817 but instabilities resumed soon after, and Singh had to flee Jorhat. The army had to return in February 1819, and reinstated Singh. A large portion of the army remained in Assam to hunt down the rebels in Upper Assam. The authority rested with the Burmese commanders, not the nominal king. Unhappy with the arrangement, Singh switched his allegiance to the British in April 1821, and tried to drive out the Burmese. His first attack on the Burmese garrison at Gauhati in September 1821 failed. But reinforced by British arms and personnel, Singh took Gauhati in January 1822, and marched to Jorhat. But the capital had been reinforced by a 20,000-strong army led by Bandula, who had just arrived. Bandula defeated Singh on 17 April 1822 at Mahgarh near Jorhat.

{"question": "The Georgian-Armenian War was a short border dispute fought in December 1918 between the newly-independent Democratic Republic of Georgia and the First Republic of Armenia, largely over the control of former districts of Tiflis Governorate, in Borchaly  and Akhalkalaki. In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October.

{"question": "During the Mexican War of Independence from Spain  the Yaqui did not participate on either side. It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes.  The first fighting was at Rahum.  The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader.  Banderas managed to get the Mayos, Opatas and Pimas to join in the war against the Mexican government.  Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo.  This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns.  After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as captain-general of the Yaqui town, and was given a salary. In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands.

{"question": "Coming off their season-opening loss to Philadelphia, Washington traveled to historic Lambeau Field to take on the Aaron Rodgers-led Green Bay Packers in a battle of defending division champions and also the first meeting between these two teams since Week 5 of 2010. This meeting marked the 30th anniversary of their meeting on October 17, 1983, in which Green Bay beat Washington 48-47 in the highest-scoring Monday Night Football game in history (although October 17 fell on a Thursday in 2013, the NFL ultimately did not schedule the teams to meet that night). Green Bay got possession first, and Washington's defense was able to stiffen once Green Bay got deep into their territory, and the Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 28-yard field goal. After a Washington three-and-out, Green Bay drove into field goal range, but on 4th-and-3, instead of punting or kicking a long field goal, Rodgers found wide receiver Randall Cobb for a 35-yard touchdown to extend the Green Bay advantage to 10-0. Washington's struggles would continue, both offensively and defensively, in the second. Rodgers connected with Jordy Nelson for a 15-yard score to make Green Bay's advantage 17-0. Green Bay would score yet again, this time by Rodgers finding Jermichael Finley for a 3-yard score to make it 24-0. Washington finally got a drive going offensively, but after opting to not test new placekicker John Potter, who was filling in for an injured Kai Forbath, Washington could not convert a fourth down, and Green Bay began driving yet again. Washington got a reprieve, however, when Randall Cobb, extending for the pylon to try to make it 31-0 right before halftime, lost control of the ball, fumbled at the pylon, awarding the ball to Washington by way of a touchback, finishing the first half scoring at 24-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took possession again. Green Bay would continue to take it to Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington got the ball back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Gar&#231;on for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers running back James Starks raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally and was once again able to sustain its offense, once again, when the game was either out of reach or close to it. Griffin found rookie tight end Jordan Reed for a 3-yard score. After a Green Bay punt, Washington scored again, this time by way of Griffin floating a pass to the corner of the end zone for veteran wide receiver Santana Moss to cut the deficit to 38-20. Needing a two-point conversion to cut the deficit to two scores, Washington failed in this endeavor, and kicked the ball back to Green Bay. After two stops on first and second down, Rodgers went back to the air on 3rd-and-9, and connected with James Jones, and Washington never saw the ball again. Green Bay ran out the clock and preserved the 38-20 win. With the loss, Washington fell to 0-2 for the first time since 2006, and remained in the NFC East Cellar. Washington also allowed Green Bay to have a 100-yard rusher. The last time Green Bay had a 100-yard rusher was in Week 5 of the 2010 season, also against Washington, when Brandon Jackson racked up over 100 yards on the Redskins, although Washington won that game. Green Bay set a franchise record, as Aaron Rodgers' 480 passing yards tied Matt Flynn for the most in a game, and James Starks' 100-yard rushing performance snapped a 44-game streak of games without a 100-yard rusher for Green Bay.

The last East Prussian town loyal to the Polish king, Kneiphof, was taken on June 14, 1455 after a long siege by the Teutonic Knights commanded by Heinrich Reuss von Plauen the Elder. The Poles suffered defeat after defeat, and they later also lost Warmia . However, the Grand Master was unable to pay his mercenaries and they took Marienburg, Dirschau, and Eylau  in May 1455. Mercenaries under the Bohemian Ulrich Czerwonka  immediately started negotiations with Poland to discuss selling the castles. The international situation also became significantly worse. On March 25, Emperor Frederick III banned the Prussian Confederation, forbidding trade with its members. On September 24, 1455, Pope Callixtus III warned that he would excommunicate the Prussian Confederation and all its allies unless they made peace with the Order.

{"question": "The Russo-Circassian War  involved a series of battles and wars in Circassia, the northwestern part of the Caucasus, in the course of the Russian Empire's conquest of the Caucasus. Fighting lasted approximately 101 years, starting in the reign of Empress Catherine the Great and finishing in 1864. Although the Russian conquest of the Caucasus started at least as early as the Russo-Persian Wars, the term Caucasian War commonly refers only to the period 1817-1864. Those who use the term Russian-Circassian War take its starting date as 1763, when the Russians began establishing forts, including at Mozdok, to be used as springboards for conquest. The Caucasian War ended with the signing of loyalty oaths by Circassian leaders on 2 June\u00a0\u00a01864. Afterwards, the Ottoman Empire offered to harbour the Circassians who did not wish to accept the rule of a Christian monarch, and many emigrated to Anatolia, the heart of the Ottoman territory and ended up in modern Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Iraq and Kosovo. Different smaller numbers ended up in neighbouring Persia. Various Russian, Caucasus, and Western historians agree on the figure of ca. 500,000 inhabitants of the highland Caucasus being deported by Russia in the 1860s.

King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.

{"question": "The race in the AFC West continued to heat up in December, especially when the Chiefs took on the San Diego Chargers on prime-time national television.  The Chiefs entered the game fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive while the San Diego Chargers looked to secure the home field advantage in the playoffs. The game was scheduled to be broadcast on CBS at 1pm San Diego time, but on December 4, the game was officially chosen to be aired on NBC Sunday Night Football at 8:15 ET (6:15 San Diego time) as part of the league's new \"flex scheduling\" policy.  The game marked the first time the Chiefs appeared on NBC Sunday Night Football, their first prime-time game in San Diego, and their first game to be aired on NBC since facing Denver in the AFC Divisional Playoff Game at Arrowhead on January 4, 1998. Publicity fueled the Sunday night match when Chiefs defensive end Tamba Hali claimed the Chargers were a \"finesse team\" eight weeks ago after Kansas City beat San Diego 30-27 at Arrowhead Stadium in week 5.  The game was the last time the Chargers lost before their seven-game winning streak leading into week 14. Prior to kickoff, there was a video tribute and moment of silence for Hunt, who died Wednesday night of complications from prostate cancer. He was 74. The Chiefs had \"LH\" decals on the backs of their helmets.  The Chiefs opted for white pants in honor of Lamar Hunt. The Chiefs got their start in Kansas City wearing white on white when playing on the road and some players appealed to coach Herm Edwards to go to the traditional look Sunday night. After getting one sack in the previous two games and none in last week's loss to Baltimore, the Chiefs were able to put some pressure on Philip Rivers in the first half. James Reed and Tamba Hali each had a sack, and the Chiefs would have had a third, but Rivers was penalized for intentional grounding when he unloaded the ball.  The Chiefs did not allow Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers to complete a pass until early in the second quarter when he threw for 18&#160;yards to Vincent Jackson.  The Chargers still led 7-3 at the time. Tomlinson broke three NFL records: single-season scoring (186 points), single-season rushing touchdowns (28) and consecutive multitouchdown games (eight).  Tomlinson's 85-yard touchdown run in the second quarter was the game's deciding play. It gave the Chargers a 14-3 lead with less than 3&#160;minutes until halftime.  The Chiefs never recovered from the botched blocked punt and let the Chargers run away with their eleventh win of the season and homefield advantage in the playoffs. Trent Green finished the game 23 of 41 with 185&#160;yards passing, no touchdowns and one interception.  It was Green's fourth loss in six games after returning from his injury in week one.  Lawrence Tynes was the only scorer for the Chiefs, kicking three field goals from 45, 52 and 24&#160;yards out.

{"question": "Those who landed at Skagway made their way over the White Pass before cutting across to Bennett Lake. Although the trail began gently, it progressed over several mountains with paths as narrow as 2 feet  and in wider parts covered with boulders and sharp rocks. Under these conditions horses died in huge numbers, giving the route the informal name of Dead Horse Trail. The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds  packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail.

{"question": "The clearance of the indigenous forest for the distillation of spirits, tanning and agricultural development began to lead to shortage of wood by the 1680s. The numbers of rats and goats had reached plague proportions by the 1690s, leading to the destruction of food crops and young tree shoots. Neither an increase on duty on the locally produced Arrack (drink) nor a duty on all firewood helped reduce the deforestation whilst attempts to reforest the island by governor John Roberts (1708\u20131711) were not followed up by his immediate successors. The Great Wood, which once extended from Deadwood Plain to Prosperous Bay Plain, was reported in 1710 as not having a single tree left standing. An early mention of the problems of soil erosion was made in 1718 when a waterspout broke over Sandy Bay, on the southern coast. Against the background of this erosion, several years of drought and the general dependency of St Helena, in 1715 governor Isaac Pyke (1714\u20131719) made the serious suggestion to the Company that appreciable savings could be made by moving the population to Mauritius, evacuated by the French in 1710. However, with the outbreak of war with other European countries, the Company continued to subsidise the island because of its strategic location. An ordinance was passed in 1731 to preserve the woodlands through the reduction in the goat population. Despite the clear connection between deforestation and the increasing number of floods (in 1732, 1734, 1736, 1747, 1756 and 1787) the East India Company\u2019s Court of Directors gave little support to efforts by governors to eradicate the goat problem. Rats were observed in 1731 building nests in trees two feet across, a visitor in 1717 commenting that the vast number of wild cats preferred to live off young partridges than the rats. An outbreak of plague in 1743 was attributed to the release of infected rats from ships arriving from India. By 1757, soldiers were employed in killing the wild cats.

While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined. At the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died. The new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom. Therefore, when James came to the English throne, his first order of business was to negotiate a peace with Philip III of Spain.

{"question": "Joaqu\u00edn de Montserrat was named viceroy of New Spain early in 1760. The transfer of power was made September 19, 1760 in Otumba, and his formal entry into Mexico City was October 6, 1760. Among his immediate and most important concerns was the organization of a true colonial army. As he passed through Puebla he reviewed a battalion of militia formed of Negroes and Mulattoes. Their arms were very irregular, and the new viceroy made a formal request to Spain for new rifles to arm them. In 1761 there was an epidemic of smallpox that principally attacked the Indians. Estimates were 14,600 dead in Mexico City and up to 80,000 in Puebla. The government nearly emptied its coffers  to provide what palliative assistance was possible. Viceroy Montserrat took economy measures, ordered the collection of back taxes, and prohibited hoarding of foodstuffs and merchandise. On November 20, 1761, Mayas under Jacinto Canek rose in rebellion in Cisteil, Yucatan. Canek was captured, and on December 14, 1761 he was tortured and quartered in the plaza of Valladolid. Other disasters during Montserrat's term of office included a major flood in Guanajuato that paralyzed the operation of the silver mines , and another epidemic  that caused many deaths . He also had to send military assistance to Sonora, where a revolt of Pimas and Seris had broken out against their maltreatment by the Spanish colonists.

{"question": "Convention uses the name \"The English Civil War\"  to refer collectively to the civil wars in England and the Scottish Civil War, which began with the raising of King Charles I's standard at Nottingham on 22 August 1642, and ended on 3 September 1651 at the Battle of Worcester. There was some continued organised Royalist resistance in Scotland, which lasted until the surrender of Dunnottar Castle to Parliament's troops in May 1652, but this resistance is not usually included as part of the English Civil War. The English Civil War can be divided into three: the First English Civil War , the Second English Civil War , and the Third English Civil War . For the most part, accounts summarise the two sides that fought the English Civil Wars as the Royalist Cavaliers of Charles I of England versus the Parliamentarian Roundheads. However, as with many civil wars, loyalties shifted for various reasons, and both sides changed significantly during the conflicts. During this time, the Irish Confederate Wars  continued in Ireland, starting with the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and ending with the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Its incidents had little or no direct connection with those of the Civil War, but the wars were mixed with, and formed part of, a linked series of conflicts and civil wars between 1639 and 1652 in the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, which at that time shared a monarch, but were distinct states in political organisation. These linked conflicts are also known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms by some recent historians, aiming to have a unified overview, rather than treating parts of the other conflicts as a background to the English Civil War.

Kabul became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, with its population growing fourfold from 2001 to 2014. This was partly due to the return of refugees after the fall of the Taliban regime, and partly due to Afghans moving from other provinces mainly due to war between Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces in their native areas as well as looking for labor. This resulting rapid urbanization mean that many residents today live in informal settlements. Shanty mud-brick homes on the mountainsides and steep hills have been built by them and these are usually poverty-stricken, not connected to the water and electricity grid.

The match-up between the Bills and Patriots was highly anticipated in the week before the meeting. Both teams had won their first games of the new season and high expectations for the season ahead were falling on both teams, including the host team, who were led by new head coach and old Patriots' foe Rex Ryan (formerly of the New York Jets). The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins.

The first main city to be attacked, V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga, capitulated on 27 April 1487, with local supporters of Boabdil directly aiding the Christian besiegers.  M\u00e1laga held out during an extended siege that lasted from 7 May 1487 until 18 August 1487; its commander preferred death to surrender, and the African garrison and Christian renegades  fought tenaciously, fearing the consequences of defeat.  Near the end, the notables of M\u00e1laga finally offered a surrender, but Ferdindad refused, as generous terms had already been offered twice.  When the city finally fell, Ferdinand punished almost all the inhabitants for their stubborn resistance with slavery, while renegades were burned alive or pierced by reeds.

The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins. Brady kneeled on the ensuing drive, securing the 40-32 win. The Bills' fans failed to set the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd noise.

{"question": "The game started out slow for both the Texans and Chiefs, but with Kansas City poised to score first, rookie placekicker Justin Medlock missed a 30-yard field goal. The Texans used their second possession to advance to the red zone, but a pass from Matt Schaub intended for Andre Johnson was intercepted by Chiefs safety Jarrad Page in the end zone. Beginning the second quarter, Chiefs center Casey Wiegmann fumbled the ball, but it was recovered by quarterback Damon Huard. After a possession by the Texans, kick returner Eddie Drummond fumbled and the ball was recovered by Houston. The Texans capitalized on the turnover and scored first through a field goal. With just over six minutes left in the half, Matt Schaub completed a 77-yard pass to Andre Johnson, and the Texans secured their lead, 10-0. Beginning the third quarter, Chiefs fullback Kris Wilson appeared to have fumbled the football, although it was disputed whether or not he had possession. The fumble was recovered by Texans defensive end Mario Williams for a touchdown. The Chiefs finally scored, through a field goal, with thirty seconds remaining in the third quarter. For the first ten minutes of play in the fourth quarter, the Texans controlled the ball and kept the Chiefs' offense off the field. When the Chiefs received their first chance to score in the fourth quarter with just over five minutes remaining, they failed to capitalize on offense.

{"question": "After the fall of Pegu, remnants of Mon resistance fell back to the upper Tenasserim peninsula , and remained active there with Siamese support. However, the resistance was disorganized, and did not control any major towns. It remained active only because Konbaung's control of the upper Tenasserim peninsula in 1757-1759 was still largely nominal. Its effective control still did not extend beyond Martaban as the majority of the Konbaung armies were back north in Manipur and in the northern Shan states. However, no single southern leader emerged to rally the Mon populace as Alaungpaya did with the Burmans in 1752. A rebellion broke out in 1758 throughout Lower Burma but was put down by local Konbaung garrisons. The window of opportunity came to a close in the second half of 1759 when the Konbaung armies, having conquered Manipur and the northern Shan states, were back down south, preparing for their invasion of the Tenasserim coast and Siam. The Konbaung armies seized the upper Tenasserim coast following the Burmese-Siamese War , and pushed out the Mon resistance farther down the coast.

{"question": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.

{"question": "Protracted action at Verdun throughout 1916, combined with the bloodletting at the Somme, brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts using frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French and led to the widespread French Army Mutinies, after the failure of the costly Nivelle Offensive of April-May 1917. The concurrent British Battle of Arras was more limited in scope, and more successful, although ultimately of little strategic value. A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada. The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack  at Passchendaele . This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud. Casualties, though disputed, were roughly equal, at some 200,000-400,000 per side. The years of trench warfare on the Western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging.

Leading unionist figures, such as the Earl of Midleton,  Lord Dunraven, James Campbell and Horace Plunkett were appointed in December 1922 by WT Cosgrave to the Free State's first Senate. Amongst others, Horace Plunkett's home in County Dublin was then burnt down during the Irish Civil War  because of his involvement in the Irish Senate. The IUA helped form the Southern Irish Loyalist Relief Association to assist war refugees and claim compensation for damage to property. From 1921 IUA voters began to support the mainstream Cumann na nGaedheal party. In the 1923 election three formerly loyalist businessmen were elected as the Business and Professional Group. From 1921 to 1991 the proportion of Southern Irish Protestants declined from 10% to 3% of the population; these had provided the bulk of the IUA's support base. Unionists continued to have a majority on Rathmines Council until 1929, when the IUA's successors lost their last elected representatives in the Irish Free State.

{"question": "The main legacy of the Revolt of the Barretinas was an enduring anti-French sentiment in the Catalan leadership and intelligentsia.  This would become relevant a decade later in 1700, when King Charles II died without a son.  Charles' death triggered the War of the Spanish Succession.  The two claimants were the French Philip, Duke of Anjou and the Austrian Emperor Leopold I.  The Spanish government chose Philip; French King Louis XIV, Philip's grandfather, naturally supported his grandson as well.  The Catalan upper classes, still distrustful of France from its efforts to stir the peasantry against them in 1689, had no love for Philip.  He was \"a king chosen by Castilians.\"  In 1702, the cortes voted to recognize Leopold as king, and full-scale rebellion against Philip began in 1705 with the arrival of supporting Austrian troops.  The war would continue for nine more years, until the Siege of Barcelona in 1714 when the last remaining Catalan supporters of Leopold were defeated by the combined Franco-Castilian army.  The Nueva Planta decrees, issued by Philip from 1707-1714, ended the nominal split between Castile and Aragon and eliminated the traditional autonomy Aragon had kept.

Members received an annual salary of $1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of $8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at $3,000. In 1907, salaries were raised to $7,500 per year, the equivalent of $173,000 in 2010. In 2006, members of Congress received a yearly salary of $165,200. Congressional leaders were paid $183,500 per year. The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns $212,100 annually. The salary of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate for 2006 was $183,500, equal to that of the Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives and Party leaders of the United States Senate. Privileges include having an office and paid staff. In 2008, non-officer members of Congress earned $169,300 annually. Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American Household income in the United States of $45,113 for men and $35,102 for women. Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government.

{"question": "On Monday Night Football, the Bears traveled west to face the 2-6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete.

{"question": "Ivan III considered himself an heir to the fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Rus' and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'. Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The Mongol Yoke ended in 1480 with the defeat of Akhmat Khan of the Golden Horde in the Great stand on the Ugra river. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and the Principality of Tver in 1483. Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests. Around 1486-87, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian-Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Muscovy, allied with Me\u00f1li I Giray, khan of the Crimean Khanate. Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk; raided Mosalsk; and attacked territory of the Dukes of Vyazma. Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians. Ivan III officially declared war in 1493, but the conflict soon ended. Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate a peace treaty. An \"eternal\" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494. The agreement marked the first Lithuanian territorial losses to Moscow: the Principality of Vyazma and a sizable region in the upper reaches of the Oka River. The lost area was estimated to be approximately 87,000\u00a0km2 . A day before the official confirmation of the treaty, Alexander Jagiellon was betrothed to Helena, daughter of Ivan III .

{"question": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed.

{"question": "In 1656, the first successful iron works in Plymouth Colony was established on the Two Mile River, in what is now part of Raynham. The Taunton Iron Works operated for over 200 years until 1876. It was the first of many iron industries in Taunton. During the 19th century, Taunton became known as the \"Silver City\", as it was home to many silversmithing operations, including Reed & Barton, F.B. Rogers, and Poole Silver. In the 19th century, Taunton was also the center of an important iron-making industry, utilizing much bog iron from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves , tacks  and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works  also operated in the city during this time. Taunton was also home to several textile mills  and other industries, such as felt  and brick making. During the 19th century, Taunton was a major shipping point for grain from the inland rural farm areas of Massachusetts to the rest of the nation via Weir Village and the Taunton River. With the advent of the railroad, Taunton would also become an important transportation hub due to its central location. The city formed the Taunton Municipal Light Plant  in 1897, when it decided to purchase the floundering Taunton Electric Lighting Company, making it a publicly owned electric utility.

{"question": "This time, Pagan could not do anything to retake Martaban because it was facing an existential threat from the north. The Mongols demanded tribute, in 1271 and again in 1273. When Narathihapate refused both times, the Mongols systematically invaded the country. The first invasion in 1277 defeated the Burmese at the battle of Ngasaunggyan, and secured their hold of Kanngai . In 1283-1285, their forces moved south and occupied down to Tagaung and Hanlin. The king fled to Lower Burma in 1285 before agreeing to submit to the Mongols in June 1286. Soon after the agreement was finalised, the king was assassinated in July 1287. The Mongols once again invaded south toward Pagan. Recent research indicates that Mongol armies may not have reached Pagan itself, and that even if they did, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal. But the damage was already done. All the vassal states of Pagan revolted right after the king's death, and went their own way. In the south, Wareru, the man who had seized the governorship of Martaban in 1281, consolidated Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma, and declared Ramannadesa  independent.

{"question": "Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia.

{"question": "By September 1545, the war was a virtual stalemate; both sides, running low on funds and troops, unsuccessfully sought help from the German Protestants. Henry, Francis, and Charles attempted extensive diplomatic maneuvering to break the deadlock; but none of the three trusted the others, and this had little practical effect. In January 1546, Henry sent the Earl of Hertford to Calais, apparently preparing for an offensive; but one failed to materialize. Francis could not afford to resume a large-scale war, and Henry was concerned only for the disposition of Boulogne. Negotiations between the two resumed on 6 May. On 7 June 1546, the Treaty of Ardres\u2014also known as the Treaty of Camp\u2014was signed by Claude d'Annebault, Pierre Ramon, and Guillaume Bochetel on behalf of Francis, and Viscount Lisle, Baron Paget and Nicholas Wotton on behalf of Henry. By its terms, Henry would retain Boulogne until 1554, then return it in exchange for two million \u00e9cus; in the meantime, neither side would construct fortifications in the region, and Francis would resume payment of Henry's pensions. Upon hearing the price demanded for Boulogne, the Imperial ambassador told Henry that the city would remain in English hands permanently. During the treaty negotiations, two Protestant mediators\u2014Han Bruno of Metz and Johannes Sturm\u2014were concerned that Henry's war in Scotland was a stumbling block. The sixteenth article of the treaty made Scotland a party to the new peace, and Henry pledged not to attack the Scots again without cause.

{"question": "Coach Coughlin's former team dominated the Giants in 2006, when he faced them for the first time. For this rematch, the Giants were without their two star receivers; Smith's pectoral injury caused him to miss his third game, while Nicks underwent treatment for compartment syndrome caused by a leg injury in Philadelphia. The Giants had signed Michael Clayton during the week to bolster their receiving situation, but he saw little action in this game. For the first three quarters, the Jaguars' defense held the Giants to three Tynes field goals; this was now the third straight game in which the Giants were held to 6 points or fewer in the first half. Rashad Jennings and David Garrard provided Jacksonville with two rushing touchdowns to take a 17-6 lead at halftime. The offense finally came to life at the end of the third quarter, when big plays by Jacobs and Boss set up a 26-yard Manningham touchdown reception followed by a two-point Bradshaw run. Later in the fourth quarter, Manning led the Giants down the field on a 6-play, 61-yard drive, culminating in a go-ahead 32-yard touchdown catch by Boss. The Jaguars threatened a comeback, and even made it into New York territory after the two-minute warning. But Justin Tuck, Antrel Rolle, Jason Pierre-Paul, and Terrell Thomas combined to sack Garrard on three consecutive plays, the last of which resulted in a fumble that was recovered by Rolle.

{"question": " The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive to the Patriots 33, but went for it on 4th-and-1 instead of kicking the field goal and Bernard Pierce was tackled for a loss. The Ravens forced a punt and Flacco engineered a 92-yard  touchdown drive to trim the lead to 30-28 with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Smith. On the Patriots ensuing possession, Brady was intercepted by Ladarius Webb, but Webb was flagged for illegal contact and the Patriots retained possession. They reached the Ravens 44, but on 2nd-and-9, Brady was sacked for a 7-yard loss moving the ball back to the Patriots 49, and his 3rd-down pass was incomplete, forcing a punt. Taking over at their own 21 with 1:55 to go, Flacco hit Jacoby Jones for a 24-yard gain. Baltimore was able to reach the Patriots 34 where Flacco threw an incompletion on 3rd-and-9, but Devin McCourty was flagged for pass interference, moving the ball to the 7-yard line. Justin Tucker kicked a field goal that appeared to miss wide right, but was controversially ruled good and the Ravens won 31-30. With this loss New England fell to 1-2. The Ravens not only avenged the AFC Championship defeat by winning their first-ever regular season meeting against their opponent, but the Patriots faced their first sub-.500 record in 145 games since starting the 2003 season 0-1 against the Buffalo Bills, and also stumbled to their first 1-2 start since 2001. This was the fourth time in the previous ten seasons the Pats had lost consecutive games.  Also, in what turned out to be the replacement officials' next-to-last game officiating, the game was marred by a series of questionable calls that eventually provoked the Ravens fans to start chanting derogatory words towards the referees; Patriots coach Bill Belichick was seen to try to grab one of the officials as they were scurrying from the field. The Patriots were one of six 2011 season playoff teams to be under .500 after their first three games;  the others were the Steelers, Broncos, Lions, Packers, and Saints (who were sitting at 0-3 by this time).

{"question": "The Russo-Swedish War of 1495-1497 was a result of an alliance between Grande Prince Ivan III of Moscow and Hans of Denmark, who was waging war against the Sture family of Sweden in the hope of regaining the Swedish throne. It is believed that Hans promised to concede some stretches of Finnish lands to the Muscovite prince, although he did not bother to honour the agreement after he had been crowned King of Sweden at the close of the war. Pursuant to the agreement, Ivan III sent Princes Daniil Shchenya and Vasily Shuisky to lay siege to the Swedish castle of Viborg. The siege lasted for three months and ended when a castellan set his supply of powder on fire, thus \"scaring the Muscovites out of their wits\", as the Swedish records say . The following year Russian generals Vasily Kosoy and Andrey Chelyadnin severely devastated Swedish Finland as far as H\u00e4meenlinna . Sten Sture the Elder, who was then at Turku , was enraged at the news of the Muscovite expedition and sent Svante Nilsson with 2,000 men to take Ivangorod, a new fortress which Ivan III had built to protect Russian Ingria against Livonian Knights. The fortress was taken without difficulty, but \u2014 as it was obviously impossible to defend it for a considerable period of time \u2014 Svante Nilsson proposed to hand it over to the Knights, an offer which they declined. Thereupon the Swedes set the fortress ablaze and sailed home.

For the first time since the declaration of independence from Spain in 1581, the Dutch were reunited with the Southern Netherlands in a constitutional monarchy, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The union lasted just 15\u00a0years. In 1830, a revolution in the southern half of the country led to the de facto independence of the new state of Belgium. The bankrupt Dutch East India Company was liquidated on 1 January 1800, and its territorial possessions were nationalized as the Dutch East Indies.Anglo-Dutch rivalry in Southeast Asia continued to fester over the port of Singapore, which had been ceded to the British East India Company in 1819 by the sultan of Johore. The Dutch claimed that a treaty signed with the sultan's predecessor the year earlier had granted them control of the region. However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded Malacca and their bases in India to the British, and recognized the British claim to Singapore. In return, the British handed over Bencoolen and agreed not to sign treaties with rulers in the \"islands south of the Straits of Singapore\".

{"question": "The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run.

RB Frank Gore set a franchise record with 148 yards rushing in the first half and scored on a 61-yard run before leaving with a concussion. San Francisco led 13-3 at halftime after scoring on three of its first four drives, wishing it had a bigger lead after out gaining Detroit 247-102 yards and recovering a fumble without giving up a turnover. The 49ers had chances to go ahead big in the third quarter because Detroit had two turnovers on its first three plays, but they came away with only a field goal and a 13-point lead. Gore then caught a 7-yard pass, wobbled off the field and didn't return. QB Alex Smith's fumble midway through the third quarter set up a score that helped the Lions get back in the game. The 49ers drove down the field to set up K Joe Nedney's fourth field goal, a key score because it made Detroit go for a TD instead of kicking a tying field goal late in the game. S Keith Lewis intercepted QB Jon Kitna's pass at the 49ers' 2 with 2&#189; minutes left and San Francisco now 4-5 picked up the one first down it needed to seal the game, winning consecutive games for the second time since 2003. RB Frank Gore finished with career-high 159 yards rushing and San Francisco's QB Alex Smith was 14 of 20 for 136 yards with a fumble. WR Arnaz Battle caught six passes for 55 yards, and converted a third-and-4 on the final drive to allow the 49ers to run out the clock. The 49ers' defense again came up huge, allowing only 273 total offensive yards and forcing 4 turnovers.

{"question": " Kellen Clemens was named the starting quarterback on Monday by Coach Eric Mangini, relegating Chad Pennington to the backup role indefinitely. However, Clemens would not be throwing to receiver Laveranues Coles, who ended a 104-game consecutive games played streak due to a concussion. Leon Washington got the Jets started immediately when he returned the opening kickoff 86&#160;yards for a touchdown. The kickoff return touchdown was his third of the season, setting a Jets record. The teams traded field goals before Clemens led the Jets downfield, where he found tight end Joe Kowalewski on a one-yard touchdown. The Redskins responded with a 40-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham. They then surprised the Jets with an onside kick, which they successfully recovered, leading to another Suisham field goal near the end of the first half. Suisham continued to keep the Redskins in the game with a 40-yard field goal to start the third quarter, bringing the score to 17-12. The Jets drove deep into Redskins territory early in the fourth quarter when, on a pass completion to Jerricho Cotchery, Cotchery fumbled the ball, and the Redskins recovered. Mangini challenged the call believing the pass was incomplete, and therefore no fumble was possible, but the challenge was not upheld. The Redskins took advantage on the ensuing drive, and running back Clinton Portis, who had a huge game against the porous Jets run defense, scored on a one-yard touchdown to give Washington the lead. A two-point conversion from quarterback Jason Campbell to Antwaan Randle El put the Redskins up by three. The Jets eventually got the ball back late in the game, and Clemens led the offense on a 15-play drive ending with a Mike Nugent 30-yard field goal with ten seconds left to force overtime. The Jets won the coin toss to start the extra frame and received the ball first. They began with a 39-yard pass from Clemens to Cotchery, but the drive quickly stalled and the Jets were forced to punt. Campbell and Portis led the Redskins downfield into the field goal range of Suisham, who hit his fifth field goal of the day to give the Redskins the win and send the Jets to their sixth straight loss.

{"question": "After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia  returned to Poland.

The Texans began their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts, a division rival in which they had only beaten once ever. However, Houston got off to an early 13-0 lead after 30 and 49-yard field goals from Neil Rackers (who had recently replaced Kris Brown as the team's kicker) and a 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Schaub, leading passer in the league a year ago, to Kevin Walter. As expected, the Colts wouldn't go down without a fight as Indy scored ten unanswered points to close out the half on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Peyton Manning to Reggie Wayne and a 20-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri.

{"question": "There were two main movements for the west side. The first one was performed while Ottomans were dealing with the Greek uprising, see Greek War of Independence.The Greeks' independence war led to the Russian forces advancing into Bulgaria before the Turks sued for peace. The resulting Treaty of Adrianople  on September 14, 1829, gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. The second independence movement happened during the uprisings. See Bosnia and Herzegovina: 19th-20th centuries, Romanian War of Independence. An uprising against Ottoman rule began in Herzegovina in July 1875. The Bulgarians organised the April Uprising, which lasted from April to May 1876. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia  until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. The uprisings raised a chance for Russia  and Austria-Hungary , who made the secret Reichstadt Agreement on July 8, on partitioning the Balkan peninsula depending on the outcome. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, in February 1878 the Russian army had almost reached the Ottoman capital but, scared the city might fall, the British sent a fleet of battleships to intimidate Russia from entering the Ottoman capital. Under pressure from the British fleet to negotiate on the outcome of the war, Russia agreed a settlement under the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, by which the Ottoman Empire recognized the independence of its former provinces Romania, Serbia and Montenegro and autonomy of Bulgaria.

However, the impossibility of removing the British from Singapore, which was becoming an increasingly important centre of trade, became apparent to the Dutch, and the disagreement was resolved with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Under its terms, the Netherlands ceded Malacca and their bases in India to the British, and recognized the British claim to Singapore.

In 1266, the Genoese had made an alliance with Baibars, who was to outfit some troops for an expedition against Acre, but the Genoese' promised fleet never got underway. In 1267, Genoa managed to capture the Tower of Flies and blockade the harbour of Acre for twelve days before being evicted by a Venetian flotilla. The ongoing warfare between Genoa and Venice had a major negative impact on the Kingdom's ability to withstand external threats to its existence. Save for the religious buildings, most of the fortified and defended edifices in Acre had been destroyed at one point or other  and according to Rothelin, the continuator of William of Tyre's History, 20,000 men in total had lost their lives, a frightful number considering the Crusader states were chronically short on soldiery.

{"question": "Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia.

Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \"subject\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general Liu Qi  won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang . Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive.

The opening kickoff was fumbled by Ravens returner Chris Carr and recovered by McGowan at the Ravens' 12-yard line. However, the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position, settling for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal to give them an early 3-0 lead. The Ravens began their first drive from their own 19-yard line and advanced on a 15-play drive, capping it with a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Flacco to wide receiver Derrick Mason. The Patriots responded with a 14-play drive of their own, going 76 yards before Brady scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to re-establish a Patriots lead at 10-7. The Ravens reached midfield on their next drive with a 22-yard reception by tight end Todd Heap, but the drive stalled at the Patriots' 38-yard line, setting up a punt by Sam Koch that gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line. Similarly, the Patriots reached Ravens' territory before having to punt; Hanson's punt landed in the end zone for a touchback. On the second play of the Ravens' ensuing drive, left tackle Jared Gaither injured his head falling into Flacco during a block; while he had motion in his extremities, the game was stopped for 15 minutes as Gaither was loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital for tests. The Ravens' drive finished as a three-and-out. The Patriots then went 63 yards on six plays, extending their lead to 17-7 on a 12-yard touchdown run by Morris. With just under four minutes remaining in the half, the Ravens mounted a drive that reached the Patriots' 17-yard line with 1:17 left; Flacco was intercepted by Bodden to prevent the Ravens from scoring again before halftime. The Patriots first drive of the second half was aided by a 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalty on the Ravens' bench, but the Patriots were unable to capitalize as a Matt Light holding penalty and a Jarret Johnson sack of Brady forced a punt. Starting from their own 16-yard line, the Ravens advanced to their 45-yard line before a Wright sack of Flacco set up another punt. Kevin Faulk fielded the return but fumbled; Bodden recovered the fumble for the Patriots at their own 14-yard line. On the next play, Brady dropped back and was strip-sacked from his blind side by Terrell Suggs; defensive lineman Dwan Edwards recovered the fumble for the Ravens in the end zone for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 17-14. Brady quickly recovered, hitting passes to Taylor for 13 yards, Aiken for 26 yards, and Moss for 20 yards to put the Patriots in the Ravens' red zone. Three plays later, Brady and Moss connected for their first touchdown of the season; the 14-yard strike extended the Patriots' lead to 24-14. The Ravens had similar success on his next drive, with Flacco hitting Mark Clayton on a 13-yard catch, Mason on a 20-yard catch, and then running back Ray Rice breaking a 50-yard rush to put the Ravens well into Patriots territory. A few plays later, Flacco kept pace with Brady on a 13-yard touchdown pass to running back Willis McGahee to cut the Patriots' lead to 24-21. The Patriots would control the ball for the next seven minutes, reaching the Ravens' 9-yard line on a second down.

{"question": "The Vikings' twelfth game was an interconference duel with the Bills inside their dome and the first home game for interim head coach Leslie Frazier. On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak.  In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by RB Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard TD run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard TD pass to TE David Nelson.
